"""Summarising compaction for OpenAI-compatible backends.

WHY THIS EXISTS ALONGSIDE TRIMMING
    ``context_budget`` keeps a turn inside the served window by DROPPING
    messages. That is free and deterministic, and it is also blind: the oldest
    message it evicts may be the delegation report the whole experiment turns
    on, and nothing downstream can tell that it went. Compaction replaces that
    span with a summary instead, so the decisions survive and only the prose
    around them is lost.

    The cost is one generation per compaction event — not per turn, because the
    result is memoised on the span it was built from. An earlier version of
    this argument put the cost far higher by confusing output throughput with
    total latency: prefill is much faster than generation, and continuous
    batching and prefix caching make re-reading a long input cheaper still. The
    real bill is the summary's own output tokens.

WHAT IT CANNOT PROMISE
    A summary is model output, so it can be wrong in ways a dropped message
    cannot. Trimming loses information visibly; compaction can quietly restate
    a number. That is why the summary is fenced and labelled in the message it
    produces, why the full transcript is still what lands on disk, and why the
    run records which policy it used — an analysis can condition on it.

THE INVARIANTS IT SHARES WITH TRIMMING
    The first user turn is never summarised away: evicting it is the server bug
    this whole subsystem exists to avoid. The kept tail never opens on an
    orphaned ToolMessage. And a failure to summarise is never a failed turn —
    it falls back to trimming, which always works.
