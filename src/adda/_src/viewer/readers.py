No HTTP here — every function takes a path (or a live ``Graph``) and returns

Graceful degradation is the load-bearing contract throughout: a run that
hasn't started yet, or was started without the debug flag, must produce an
empty/"not available" result from these functions, never an exception — the

    no real relationship to actual turn-file numbering and would 404 or
    open the wrong turn silently — found and removed, not left as a
    latent bug).

    Two on-disk layouts exist and a node can use EITHER, so both are
    checked and the results merged:

    * flat ``transcripts/<delegation id>.jsonl`` — a worker's per-delegation
      transcript, keyed by the id of a delegation TO that node;
    * nested ``transcripts/<node name>/<stem>.jsonl`` — used by the entry
      node (``turn_001``) and, discovered the hard way, by the critic
      (``call_001``). The critic has delegation rows (its gate check) whose
      ids do NOT correspond to any flat file, so returning ids alone
      offered a key that resolves to nothing: on run 20260905T162758 the
      critic's transcript sat at ``transcripts/critic/call_001.jsonl``

    The nested directory is keyed on the node's OWN name rather than the
    literal "strategizer", so a graph whose entry node is called something
    else still finds its turns. *is_entry* is consequently no longer needed
    to pick a layout; it is kept so existing callers keep working.

    Keys are never computed from a formula. A prior version guessed the
    entry node's turn as
    ``f"strategizer/turn_{len(delegations_touching_it):03d}"``, which bore
