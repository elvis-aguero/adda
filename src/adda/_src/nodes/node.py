"""``Node`` — the one kind of thing the agent graph is made of.

There is no hierarchy of node types here, and deliberately so. A node has
outgoing edges or it does not, and that single fact decides everything that
differs between two nodes:

    def __call__(self, state):
        return self._orchestrate(state) if self._outgoing else self._respond(state)

Everything else a node can do comes from what its ``Agent`` DECLARES in
``tools`` (see ``nodes/tools/routing``), never from what it is. The
strategizer, the implementer and the critic are all this class; they differ by
the name they are registered under, the prompt they carry, and the tools they
declare — which is exactly how a reader should think about them.

The two behaviours live in ``orchestration`` and ``leaf``; the remaining
mixins are per-concern, not per-type: ``recording`` (notes, retrospectives),
``critic_gate`` (the adversarial review), ``lifecycle`` (budget/backstop
halts), ``reproduction_gate`` (the notebook's lazy-reproduction
check). The ledger tools are a tool family like any other and live in
``nodes/tools/routing/ledger.py``.

    adapter
        The LLM adapter this node speaks through.
    name
        The node's name in the graph. This is what distinguishes one agent

    outgoing
        Names of the nodes this one may delegate to. Non-empty makes this an

        choice in the node layer.
    spec
        The whole :class:`~..backends.base.Graph`, so a node can read its
        peers' roles and descriptions.
    report_sections, agent_tools
