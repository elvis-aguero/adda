"""``Node`` — the one kind of thing the agent graph is made of.

There is no hierarchy of node types here, and deliberately so. Every node
runs the same loop:

    def __call__(self, state):
        return self._orchestrate(state)

A node with outgoing edges has somewhere to delegate; a node with none does
not (``Delegate()`` simply has no valid target) — that is the only thing
``self._outgoing`` decides. There used to be a second behaviour
(``_respond``, in a now-deleted ``leaf.py``) for a node with no outgoing
edges, reachable only for a single-agent study (every other node is dispatched
via ``Delegate()`` on a worker thread, never invoked as a graph node at all —
see ``runtime/graph_builder.py``). Single-agent studies are the exception, not
the rule, so that second behaviour is gone: a lone entry node now runs the
same delegate-or-close loop everyone else does, just with nobody to delegate
to.

Everything else a node can do comes from what its ``Agent`` DECLARES in
``tools`` (see ``nodes/tools/routing``), never from what it is. The
strategizer, the implementer and the critic are all this class; they differ by
the name they are registered under, the prompt they carry, and the tools they
declare — which is exactly how a reader should think about them.

The turn behaviour lives in ``orchestration``; the remaining mixins are
per-concern, not per-type: ``recording`` (notes, retrospectives),
``critic_gate`` (the adversarial review), ``lifecycle`` (budget/backstop
halts), ``reproduction_gate`` (the notebook's lazy-reproduction
check). The ledger tools are a tool family like any other and live in
``nodes/tools/routing/ledger.py``.

Construction installs the same capability closures on every node's adapter
regardless of ``outgoing`` — sandboxed ``Write``, ``ReportEvals``,
``RecallHistory``, and the declaration-gated read-only store/ledger tools
(:meth:`Node._init_capabilities`). This matters even for a node that never
takes a turn of its own: ``runtime/graph_builder.py`` hands every named node's
adapter to whichever OTHER node may ``Delegate()`` to it
(``worker_adapters``), and ``ClaudeAdapter.copy()`` returns ``self`` — so a
dispatched worker's ``closure_tools`` dict IS the same one this construction-
time setup populated. Losing it here would be a silent regression for every
delegated specialist, not just the rare standalone leaf.
