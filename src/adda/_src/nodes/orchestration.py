"""The behaviour of a node that HAS outgoing edges: it delegates.

One of the two behaviours :class:`~.node.Node` dispatches between, and the
only one that runs a multi-turn loop: it reads Reports, decides the next
delegation, and owns the run's gates (budget, critic, reproduction). A node
has this behaviour because of its TOPOLOGY, not its role — any node with an
outgoing edge orchestrates, whatever it is called.

``inspect.getsource(Node._orchestrate)`` reads the full routing logic.
