"""Critic-facing / run-closing tools: Done, AskForFeedback.

``FeedbackTools`` holds them, bound to one node (``self.node``);
``build_feedback_closures(node)`` at the bottom is the registration table.

``Done`` is a SEQUENCE OF GATES, and each one is its own method here, in the
order Done applies them:

1. :meth:`~FeedbackTools._pending_refusal`      — nothing may close mid-flight
2. :meth:`~FeedbackTools._capture_retrospective`— the post-accept exit interview
3. :meth:`~FeedbackTools._milestone_gate`       — process backlog, hard
4. :meth:`~FeedbackTools._first_call_warning`   — the two-shot confirm
5. :meth:`~FeedbackTools._must_reproduce`       — the deliverable must RUN
6. :meth:`~FeedbackTools._critic_gate`          — the adversarial review

Each returns the text to hand back, or None to fall through to the next. Read
top to bottom and the closing contract is the method list.
