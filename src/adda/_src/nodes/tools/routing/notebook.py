"""Notebook/deliverable-authoring tools: WriteDeliverable, CheckDeliverable,
AddPipelineMarkdownCell, AddPipelineCell, EditPipelineCell, DeletePipelineCell,
ShowNotebook, LedgerBreakdown, RunScratch, RunPipelineCell.

``NotebookTools`` holds them, bound to one node (``self.node``);
``build_notebook_closures(node)`` at the bottom is the registration table.
Tools stay PascalCase methods so their docstrings remain the model-facing
description (``prompts.tool_catalog``) and stay readable from source by the
viewer's AST scan; ``inspect.signature`` drops ``self``, so the JSON schema the
backends infer is unchanged.

The canonical cell vocabulary — the four f3dasm pillars plus the Popperian
spine — is module-level: ``_PILLARS``, ``_NB_ORDER``, ``_NARRATIVE``. It is the
same for every run, so it is stated once here rather than rebuilt per node.
