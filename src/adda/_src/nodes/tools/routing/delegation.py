"""Delegation-family tools: Delegate/Wait/GetStatus/CancelDelegation/Reply/
FollowUp/Confer/RecallHistory.

Three objects, one per scope that used to be a level of closure nesting:

``DelegationTools``  the tools an orchestrating node is handed, bound to that
                     node (``self.node``).
``WorkerSession``    one dispatched delegation — the tools the worker itself is
                     handed, plus the thread body that runs it and records the
                     outcome.
``ConferTools``      Confer, bound to one sender. Identical for the
                     orchestrator and for every worker, which is why it is its
                     own object rather than a factory.

``build_delegation_closures(node)`` at the bottom is the registration table:
tool name -> bound method. Tools stay PascalCase methods so their docstrings
remain the model-facing description (``prompts.tool_catalog`` reads ``__doc__``)
and stay readable from source by the viewer's AST scan; ``inspect.signature``
drops ``self``, so the JSON schema the backends infer is unchanged.

        A hypothesis's falsification_criterion is immutable once registered

        now the only party shown it was the delegator, and only at
        reconciliation time (``_falsification_checkpoint`` below, which
        fires on a Done report). The worker that actually produces the
        evidence never saw it: Delegate's contract put context packaging on
        the delegator ("Include in the task message everything the worker
        needs"), so the criterion reached the worker only if the delegator
        remembered to paste it.

        The measured cost of that gap: INCONCLUSIVE is the largest verdict
        class (100 of 295 hypotheses over 52 cluster runs) and the most
        expensive (median lifetime 3.15h vs 1.49h FALSIFIED, 0.91h
