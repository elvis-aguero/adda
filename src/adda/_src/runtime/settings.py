"""Central run-knob accessor — config.yaml is the source of truth.

Run KNOBS (debug, recursion_limit, idle timeouts, retry, backstop, …) live in
the ``runtime:`` block of a study's ``config.yaml``. Environment variables are
override/secrets only. Resolution precedence, per knob:

    explicit argument  >  env var (F3DASM_<UPPER_KEY>)  >  config.yaml  >  default

The explicit tier is what a caller passes as ``AgenticRun(runtime={...})``. It
outranks the environment because the docs already say that channel "is for
secrets and one-off overrides — it is not where a study's settings belong": a
stale ``F3DASM_MILESTONES_ENABLED`` left exported in a shell used to beat every
caller silently, which for a sweep means an arm that ran under a label it did
not have. An explicit argument is the most deliberate statement of intent
there is, so it wins.

``AgenticRun`` calls :func:`configure` once at run start with the parsed
``runtime`` mapping. Read sites call :func:`get_bool` / :func:`get_int` /
:func:`get_float` / :func:`get_str`. Until ``configure`` runs (e.g. in a unit
test that constructs a node directly), only env + default apply — identical to
the old ``os.environ.get`` behaviour, so the migration is backward compatible.
