"""Hand-laid-out SVG rendering of an AgenticRun's agent graph.

Shows the run's actual anatomy: every node, its role, its description, its
resolved backend/model, its full tool surface (declared + topology-injected),
and the delegation edges between nodes — generated from the live
``Graph``/``Agent`` objects, never hand-typed, so it cannot go stale the way
this repo's previous diagram did (a hand-authored
``internal/class_diagram.dot``, describing classes that no longer existed —
deleted in favor of this module).

Shows ONLY what the graph actually contains — no invented taxonomy layered on
top of it. Two earlier drafts got this wrong and were caught by direct
feedback, not self-review: (1) backend/model were shown once at the top as if
run-wide, but ``agent_runtime.py``'s own resolution
(``agent.model or self._model``, ``agent.backend or self._backend``) means
EACH node can override either — a single top-level line is simply wrong for
any graph where a node does; backend/model are now resolved and shown PER
NODE. (2) edges were split into invented "primary" vs "sub-delegate
(lateral)" categories with different line styles — there is exactly one
delegation mechanism in the code (``Delegate``, wired identically for any
outgoing edge; see ``routing.py``), so that taxonomy and its dashed-line
encoding were fabricated, not read off the system. Every edge now renders
identically; same-layer edges still curve differently than cross-layer ones
because that is a geometric necessity (routing the line around the cards
between them), not a claimed semantic difference.

Deliberately NOT run through Graphviz or any other auto-layout engine: a
run's graph is small (a handful of nodes), so a hand-computed layered
layout — BFS distance from the entry node, one row per layer — reads as a
designed diagram rather than a force-directed tool's generic output. Row
height is computed from each node's REAL content (two-pass: measure every
card, then lay out cumulative y from the actual heights) — a fixed
per-layer height silently overflowed the entry node's card in an earlier
draft once its tool count got large; caught by actually rendering and
looking at it, not assumed. SVG is the native, checked-in format: it is
resolution-independent by construction, so any DPI/pixel size (a
10000x10000 PNG included) is one rasterization step away with zero quality
loss — this module does not attempt to also ship a PNG rasterizer.

No title, no legend, no node/edge-count banner: the cards and edges are the
whole diagram — a reader does not need a caption explaining what a
delegation arrow means, and the cards already show each node's own role.
