    Parameters
    ----------
    spec : Graph
        Agent graph specification (nodes, edges, entry).
    make_adapter : callable
        ``(name: str, agent: Agent) -> adapter`` — factory that produces a
        ``ClaudeAdapter`` or ``OllamaAdapter`` for the given node.
    checkpointer : any, optional
        LangGraph checkpointer.  Defaults to an in-memory :class:`MemorySaver`.
    delegation_log : DelegationLog, optional
        Graph-wide delegation log for episodic memory (RecallHistory tool).

    Returns
    -------
    CompiledGraph
        A compiled LangGraph graph ready to invoke.
