"""Single source of truth for a run's resource-constraint state.

Every node-node interaction in this system is a delegation — human ->
strategizer (the initial problem-statement handoff), strategizer -> worker,
and strategizer -> critic (both GATE and FEEDBACK mode). Every one of them
should see the SAME live constraint facts (eval budget, wall-clock budget)
automatically, in-band, rather than something latent an agent has to go dig
for. This module computes that snapshot fresh at any delegation boundary;
both the text injected into an agent's context and the structured fields
persisted to DelegationLog come from calling this SAME function, so they can
never drift apart the way four independent, partial computations previously
did (a wall-clock-elapsed-only dispatch banner, a wall-clock-remaining-only
completion footer that only fired when eval rows were written, an eval-only
budget block hand-built inside the GATE critic call, and nothing at all in
FEEDBACK mode or the initial human handoff).
