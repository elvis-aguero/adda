"""Workspace: the vocabulary a MathExpert derivation script is written against.

See internal/specs/10-math-expert-agent.md for the design rationale. Two
categories only, not three: `assume()` records anything not mechanically
checked (verdict always ``"ASSERTED"`` — an ansatz, a physical claim, an
unverified derived relation are all the same thing from SymPy's point of
view); every other method is a real SymPy computation, correct by
construction, with a verdict (``CONFIRMED``/``REFUTED``/``INCONCLUSIVE``)
appearing only when a computed result is checked against an independent
target.

A derivation script instantiates one ``Workspace``, calls its methods in
order, and (usually) ends with ``render_latex``/``write_summary``. Each
mutating call appends one record to ``self._steps`` — that list, rendered,
*is* the sequential document; re-running the script from top to bottom is
the entire "durability" story (no separate trace/replay format).

        ``schema``  The file names its own format. Two consumers — the

            every reader to infer it, and a later change breaks them silently
            instead of loudly.
        ``counts``  The verdict tally, computed once where the verdicts are
            authoritative. Every downstream consumer was recomputing it by
            hand and then narrating the result in prose, which puts an
            arithmetic step between the evidence and the claim. ``unchecked``
            counts steps SymPy never adjudicates (truncate_series, solve_ode:
            verdict ``None``); ASSERTED is its own bucket, not a check.
        ``residual``  The evidence for a non-CONFIRMED verdict. Without it the
            contract holds for the steps that passed and fails for exactly the
            steps a skeptical reader needs to examine.
