"""The on-disk channel between a running graph and a human operator.

The run and the viewer are separate processes — the viewer is normally
started independently of the run it is watching, and may not exist at all —
so the channel between them is the run's own ``debug/`` directory rather
than a socket or a shared object. Everything here is small JSON on disk,
which also means the whole exchange is auditable after the fact: what was
asked, what was answered, and what went unanswered are all part of the run
record instead of scrolling past in a terminal.

Three things move across it:

* **questions** — ``FollowUp`` asks; the operator answers, from a terminal
  or from the viewer, whichever gets there first;
* **notes** — the operator queues a message; the entry node picks it up on
  its next tool call;
* **a watch heartbeat** — the viewer says a human is actually looking,
  which is what lets a run decide whether waiting for an answer is
  reasonable or merely a stall.

Nothing here raises on a missing directory or a malformed file: a run whose
debug dir was never created must behave exactly as one nobody is watching.
