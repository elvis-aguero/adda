"""The run watchdog itself (BACKLOG #41): a wall-clock timer that lives OUTSIDE
the run process and force-exits a genuinely wedged one.

Why outside the process. A backstop that runs as a thread inside the very
process it is meant to catch cannot be trusted — the thing most likely to be
stuck (a hung model call, a wedged simulation binding the GIL or blocked in
native code) can just as easily wedge the watchdog thread alongside it. See
``paper/sections/03-method.tex``, "A wall-clock watchdog outside the run".
So this module starts the study run as a CHILD process, in its own process
group, and owns the clock from the parent — the parent's only job is to wait
with a deadline and, on timeout, kill.

Everything :func:`run_under_watchdog` does to a wedged run on timeout reuses
the existing, already-tested cleanup primitives in ``watchdog_cleanup.py``
(``reap_process_group``, ``reap_governor_pids``, ``write_watchdog_retrospective``)
— this module adds the CALLER those functions never had inside this package,
not a second implementation of what they already do.

HEADROOM is deliberate and non-negotiable in one direction: every other budget
in this system (eval budget, cost budget) is a SOFT nudge to the agents; this
timer is the one approved hard stop, and it exists only to catch a run that
has genuinely wedged — never to police a merely slow one. The floor is
2x the run's own stated wall-clock budget (``DEFAULT_WATCHDOG_MULTIPLE`` — see
``paper/sections/03-method.tex``, "A hard timer at twice the run's time
budget"). :func:`resolve_deadline_seconds` refuses a multiple below that floor
— tightening it needs a maintainer decision, not a flag.
