"""Delegation-bounded version control of a run's agent workspace.

See ``internal/specs/11-delegation-bounded-version-control.md``.

A delegation's account of what it changed is prose the agent wrote about
itself, and nothing on disk can contradict it. This module gives the harness
a mechanical record instead: one git repository per run, one commit per
delegation, the sha stamped onto the delegation record.

Agents never see this repo and get no git tool. The harness commits on their
behalf — an agent that can rewrite the history recording its own work defeats
the point.

Nesting inside an existing repository
-------------------------------------
The workspace lives at ``runs/<ts>/debug/delegations/``, which is normally
INSIDE a checkout of adda (or of a benchmarks repo). Git's directory
discovery walks upward until it finds a ``.git``, so a plain ``git add -A``
run in that directory before the nested repo exists would find the PARENT
repository and stage the entire source tree. That is the one catastrophic
failure mode here, and every call in this module is shaped to make it
impossible rather than unlikely:

* every invocation passes ``--git-dir`` and ``--work-tree`` explicitly, so
  git never performs discovery and never walks upward — these also override
  any inherited ``GIT_DIR``/``GIT_WORK_TREE`` environment variables;
* ``_git`` refuses to run at all unless the nested ``.git`` already exists,
  so a failed or skipped init degrades to "no commits", never to "committed
  against the parent";
* the resulting sha is verified to come from the nested repo before it is
  returned, so a sha can never be a parent-repo commit.

The parent sees the nested repo as an ordinary untracked directory. adda's
own ``.gitignore`` excludes ``studies/*/runs/`` so that a careless
``git add -A`` in the parent cannot absorb it as a gitlink/submodule.

Configuration is passed per-invocation with ``-c`` rather than written into
the repo, which keeps it hermetic and immune to the user's global git config:
commit signing is disabled (a global ``commit.gpgsign`` would otherwise block
on a passphrase prompt inside a run), hooks are disabled (a global
``core.hooksPath`` could run arbitrary code), and an identity is supplied so
a machine with no configured ``user.email`` cannot fail the commit.

Nothing here is ever fatal. Version control is an observation instrument, not
a dependency of the science: every failure logs a warning and returns a value
the caller records as "no sha".
