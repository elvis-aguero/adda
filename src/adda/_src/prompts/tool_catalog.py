"""Forward-compatible tool catalog.

The prompt's ``<tools>`` section is GENERATED from the live closure set, so it
can never drift from the actual tools an agent has, and a newly-registered tool
self-documents with no hand-edit. The tool owns its guidance: its docstring is
the description, plus optional usage examples attached via ``@tool_examples``.

ONE ROUTE, BOTH BACKENDS
    A tool's full description reaches the model exactly once, in this
    ``<tools>`` section; the tool-use API definition carries only its
    one-line summary (``tool_summary``) and its parameter schema. The two
    backends used to disagree: Claude got the one line in the API and the full
    text here, the OpenAI-compatible backend got the full text in BOTH — every
    tool's documentation twice, on every model call.

    Why the full text lives here rather than in the API definition: Claude
    Code cuts an MCP tool's description at 2,048 characters, silently, and the
    Claude backend's closures are MCP tools. QueryStore's description alone is
    past that. The system prompt has no such cap, so it is the one place a
    full description is guaranteed to arrive whole.
