# adda

**You write one file. It runs the research.**

adda takes a plain-language description of an engineering design or
data-driven problem (the objective, the design space, what counts as a
valid answer) and runs a team of LLM agents that decide what to try, write
the code to evaluate it, run real experiments, check their own conclusions
before accepting them, and hand you back a notebook that reproduces the
result end to end.

That's the whole interface: one input file, one notebook back. Everything
in between, what to try first, how to test it, when to believe it, is the
system's job, not yours.

## Get started

1. [Installation](installation.md): the package, plus a model to drive the
   agents. Two commands.
2. [Quickstart](notebooks/quickstart.ipynb): a real problem in, a real
   answer out, a couple of minutes start to finish.
3. [Core concepts](concepts.md): once you've seen it run once, what the
   pieces are actually called and why.
4. [Authoring a study](authoring-a-study.md): write your own problem.

## Under the hood

adda is a graph of agents: a hub **strategizer** delegating to
specialists (**literature reviewer**, **data generator**, **implementer**,
**critic**) that keeps every claim honest with a Popperian **hypothesis
ledger** and closes every run with a **reproducible notebook**, checked end
to end before the run is allowed to close, rather than written up afterward.

It builds on [f3dasm](https://github.com/bessagroup/f3dasm) for the
data-driven primitives and adds the agentic orchestration on top.
