# Authoring a study

A **study** is the single input to a run. It's a folder you prepare; a3dasm reads
it, does the work, and writes its results back into the same folder:

```python
from a3dasm import AgenticRun
AgenticRun(study_dir="my_study").execute()
```

This page shows what to put in that folder.

## What the folder contains

```
my_study/
  PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md   # required: the brief the agents work from
  config.yaml            # optional: the model, budgets, and how to evaluate a design
  workspace/             # optional: your evaluator, if you ship one
    evaluator.py
```

Everything else you'll see later (`pipeline.ipynb`, a `runs/` directory) is
**produced by the run**: you don't write it.

## `PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md` (required)

This is the whole task definition. The agents work from it and the critic checks
the result against it, so write it precisely: a vague brief produces a vague,
unverifiable answer. Cover:

- **Objective and success criteria**: the headline number or claim the run must
  deliver (e.g. "maximise the normalised buckling load; report the design and its
  value").
- **Design space**: every input variable, with its bounds, type (continuous,
  integer, or categorical), and **units**.
- **Deliverables**: anything the run must produce beyond the notebook (a plot, a
  mechanism explanation).
- **What "valid" means**: feasibility limits, regimes of validity, noise
  thresholds. State these explicitly; they're what keep the agents honest.

## `config.yaml` (optional)

Every setting has a default, so you can omit this file entirely. The settings you
can set:

| key | meaning | default |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | which language model to use | the backend's default |
| `backend` | `claude`, `ollama`, `openrouter`, or `vllm` | `claude` |
| `budget` | soft wall-clock limit, `"HH:MM:SS"` or seconds (a nudge, not a hard stop) | none |
| `eval_budget` | soft cap on how many real evaluations the run may spend | none |
| `budget_usd` | **hard** cost ceiling — halts the run when spend reaches it (resumable: raise it and resume). Inactive on a backend with no per-call cost data (e.g. Ollama) | none |
| `required_deliverables` | extra files that must exist before the run can finish | none |
| `evaluator` | how a design gets scored, see below | honor-system |

| `runtime` | run knobs — debug capture, timeouts, retry, limits; see below | all defaulted |

See [Customizing a run](customizing-a-run.md#reference-the-available-backends) for the
`backend`/`model` details, including setting them per agent instead of for
the whole run.

### `runtime:` — the run knobs

Everything that tunes *how the run executes* rather than *what it is asked to
do* lives in one nested block. Every knob has a working default, so the block
is optional; set one only when you have a reason to.

```yaml
runtime:
  debug: true            # write transcripts/diagnostics under runs/<ts>/debug/
  recursion_limit: 200   # LangGraph step ceiling for one run
```

`config.yaml` is the source of truth for these. An `F3DASM_<KEY>` environment
variable overrides the configured value, but that channel is for secrets and
one-off overrides — it is not where a study's settings belong. A key this
table does not list is ignored with a warning at startup, so a typo tells you
rather than silently reverting to the default.

| key | meaning | default |
|---|---|---|
| `debug` | capture full transcripts, diagnostics and per-delegation logs under `runs/<ts>/debug/`. Required for the run-analysis workflow | `false` |
| `hypothesis_ledger` | the run's falsifiable-hypothesis record. Off withholds its five tools and its prompt section too, so the agent is never told to use a tool that is gone. PARTIAL: the Popperian workflow is argued throughout the strategizer's method, which stays | `true` |
| `milestones_enabled` | run the process-milestone gate | `true` |
| `science_monitor` | the runtime drift monitor that flags unledgered evals and unstamped rows, and escalates repeats to the critic | `true` |
| `pipeline_deliverable` | require `pipeline.ipynb` as the deliverable; turn off for a study with no notebook | `true` |
| `recursion_limit` | LangGraph step ceiling for one run | `2000` |
| `max_consecutive_errors` | consecutive failures to one target before the run halts | `12` |
| `run_backstop_multiple` | multiple of the wall budget after which the run is force-closed | `2.0` |
| `followup_wait_s` | how long a `FollowUp` waits for a human answer | `600` |
| `llm_retry_max` | retry attempts for a failed model call | `5` |
| `llm_retry_base` | base seconds for retry backoff | `2.0` |
| `llm_stream_idle_timeout` | seconds of stream silence before a call is abandoned (`0` disables) | `600.0` |
| `llm_tool_idle_timeout` | seconds a single tool call may stall (`0` disables) | `0.0` |
| `llm_max_buffer_mb` | cap on a single response buffered in memory | `30.0` |
| `llm_metadata_fetch` | look up model metadata (context window, pricing) at startup | `true` |
| `llm_metadata_timeout_s` | seconds to wait for that lookup | `8.0` |
| `llm_quantization` | quantization hint for a locally-served model | none |
| `semantic_scholar_api_key` | Semantic Scholar key; raises the literature rate limit | none |

## How designs get evaluated (the evaluator)

The evaluator is your ground truth: the function that scores a design. It's the
one metered path: the only calls counted against `eval_budget`. (Surrogates and
optimisers the agents build on top are their own business and aren't metered.)
Declare it one of these ways:

**A function you ship**, one argument per input variable:

```yaml
evaluator:
  entrypoint: "workspace/evaluator.py:evaluate"   # path within the study folder
  output_names: [y]                               # names of what it returns
```

**A precomputed table**, each query resolves to the nearest row (results are
approximate, since a query may land between rows):

```yaml
evaluator:
  lookup:
    pool: "experiment_data"     # path within the study folder
    input_columns: [x1, x2]
    output_columns: [y]
```

**Described in the brief**: omit the `evaluator` block and describe the scoring
oracle (a binary, a dataset, a physics model) in `PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md`; the
agents write the evaluator themselves during the run.

**Nothing**: no evaluator and none described falls back to the honor system, and the
agents self-report. Fine for exploring, not for a result you want verified.

## What the run produces

At the study root you get **`pipeline.ipynb`**, the deliverable. Its opening
cells are the write-up; its code cells reproduce the headline result. Each run
also writes a timestamped folder under `runs/` with the evaluation record, logs,
and a status file. See [Understanding a run's output](reading-a-run.md) for what's
in there and how to read it.

Everything above is `config.yaml` and `PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md`; the graph itself
(which agents exist, how they delegate), each agent's system prompt, and each
agent's backend/model are Python-level extension points instead. See
[Customizing a run](customizing-a-run.md) if the built-in strategizer and
four specialists aren't the shape your problem needs.

## Before a long run, check

- `PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md` states explicit success criteria, the design space
  (bounds, types, units), and any deliverables.
- `config.yaml` parses, and its `evaluator` points at a real file/attribute or a
  real lookup pool.
- Your evaluator imports and runs on one sample without error.
- Your backend is reachable (for the default Claude backend, you're logged in;
  see [Installation](installation.md)).

## A minimal worked example

A runnable copy of this folder ships in the repository at `studies/example_study`
(it's exercised by the test suite, so it can't drift from what the runtime
actually expects).

`config.yaml`:

```yaml
model: claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
backend: claude
eval_budget: 200  # soft cap on real calls to evaluate(), not a hard stop
evaluator:
  entrypoint: "workspace/evaluator.py:evaluate"  # module:function, relative to the study
  output_names: [y]  # names the one value evaluate() returns
```

`workspace/evaluator.py`:

```python
def evaluate(x1: float, x2: float) -> float:
    """One argument per input; returns the output named in output_names."""
    return (x1 - 1.0) ** 2 + (x2 + 2.0) ** 2  # the ground truth being scored
```

`PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md`:

```markdown
# Minimise a 2-D quadratic
Objective: minimise y = (x1-1)^2 + (x2+2)^2.
Success: report the argmin (x1*, x2*) and the value y*, reproduced in
pipeline.ipynb from the run's evaluation record.
Design space: x1, x2, continuous, in [-5, 5], dimensionless.
```

Then run it:

```python
from a3dasm import AgenticRun
AgenticRun(study_dir="studies/example_study").execute()
```
