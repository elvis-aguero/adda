"""Wet integration test: all three literature sources, real network.

Each provider's search on its own, then SearchPapers -- the one call a real
literature reviewer makes, which asks all three at once and merges them.

Marked `integration` — NOT run in CI (no `SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY` there,
and CI shouldn't depend on live third-party APIs anyway). Run manually with:
    uv run pytest tests/test_literature_sources_wet.py -v -s --no-cov -m integration

Requires network + the `arxiv`, `semanticscholar`, and `requests` packages
(already project dependencies). A configured SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY (or
semantic_scholar_api_key in config.yaml's runtime: block) is what actually
exercises the authenticated path end to end — the whole reason this test
exists is to catch a REGRESSION exactly like commits 693a971/b5e655f (S2
either 403ing outright, or the pacing interval silently under-pacing the
authenticated tier) the moment it happens, instead of discovering it days
later on a real run.
