"""A bare Wait() collects whichever delegation finishes first.

Fan-out was already cheap to DISPATCH — Delegate(wait=False) is used on 85% of
real Delegate calls — but expensive to COLLECT: Wait() bound to a single
delegation id, so the only way to harvest several in flight was GetStatus
polling, which the poll-count nudges actively discourage. Measured consequence
across 39 cluster runs: reliance on Wait predicted SERIAL execution
(wait-share-of-harvest vs mean concurrent delegations r=-0.54 controlling for
delegation duration), and mean concurrency sat at 1.21 against a median 15
delegations created per run.

These cover the bare form: it harvests each finished delegation exactly once,
blocks only while nothing is ready, and refuses rather than hanging when
waiting cannot make progress.
