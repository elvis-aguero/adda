# An unexpected skip must fail the build.
#
# pyproject.toml already states the principle, in its comment on the
# playwright dependency: "without this it SKIPS, and a skipped test protects
# nothing." A skip nobody is watching for is a hole in the suite that looks
# green. So every skip reason produced in a session must be pre-approved
# here as a genuinely ENVIRONMENTAL condition -- a live external server, a
# licensed corpus that cannot ship, an optional package truly absent from
# THIS machine -- or the session fails. This is a contract about what may
# legitimately be untestable in a given environment, not a place to file
# away a skip that is actually a defect (an in-repo file that should always
# exist, a test guard that no longer applies) -- those get fixed or made to
# fail loudly instead, at their own call site.
