"""Runtime-injected text is marked as such, and the viewer renders it apart.

Nudges, science-monitor drift, budget warnings and operator notes all reach an
agent prepended to the text of its next tool result. On disk and in the viewer
that made them indistinguishable from the tool's own output.

Marking happens at the injection sites, not in the reader, because no
reader-side rule can do it: most notices carry a ``[TAG …]`` head but the
GetStatus poll hints are bare prose, and tools emit bracketed lines of their
own (``[exited 1]``, ``[output truncated to last …]``).
