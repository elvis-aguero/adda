"""A feature owns its knob, its tools and its prompt section — or it is a lie.

Turning a feature off used to disable only its runtime object. The tools stayed
registered (they gate on the agent's static `tools` frozenset, never on whether
the backing object exists) and the prompt kept commanding their use, so the
agent called a tool, got `"ERROR: ... not available in this run."`, and the run
recorded an ERROR_RETURN diagnostic — the one KPI whose target is zero. That
arm measures an agent confused by broken tools, not an agent without the
feature.

`internal/BACKLOG.md` #27, #28 and #30 are three successive rounds of exactly
this for `pipeline_deliverable` alone. These tests exist so the fourth round
does not happen to a different feature.
