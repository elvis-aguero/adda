"""The viewer, driven by a real browser.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
    ``test_viewer_app.py`` (52 tests) and ``test_viewer_readers.py`` (62) stop
    at the HTTP boundary: they prove the server answers correctly. The viewer's
    behaviour does not live there. ``templates/graph.html`` is 118 KB and 2,814
    lines carrying ~90 functions, and every one of them was unexecuted by the
    suite — the SSE subscription that makes watching a run "live", the node
    status the watcher reads, and the answer box a blocked run waits on.

    A run that stalls because the answer box silently stopped posting is a
    functional failure with a real cost: the agent waits, the wall clock burns,
    and every server test still passes.

WHAT IT ASSERTS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT
    Function only, never appearance. No screenshots, no layout, no colours, no
    element positions. Each test names a thing the viewer is FOR: the page
    renders the run's nodes; a delegation written while the page is open
    changes what is on screen without a reload; an answer typed into the box
    reaches the file the run reads; a closed run stops soliciting answers. A
    test that fails when someone restyles a button would be worse than no test,
    because it would be deleted the first time it cried wolf.

    Uncaught JavaScript errors fail every test here, whatever else passed. A
    page that renders and throws is broken in a way an HTTP assertion cannot
    see.

IF THIS IS SKIPPED, IT IS PROTECTING NOTHING
    It needs Playwright and a Chromium binary. Both are present in the
    development image (PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH), and the module skips rather
    than errors where they are not — so a green run on a machine without them
    means "not checked", not "checked and fine".
