"""Every non-Python file the package loads at runtime must be packaged.

The failure this guards is invisible in the repo and fatal on install:
``MANIFEST.in`` said ``recursive-include src *.py *.pyi``, so
``viewer/templates/graph.html`` was simply absent from the wheel. Every
test passed, the repo checkout worked, and ``pip install adda[viewer]``
produced a viewer whose only human-facing page returned 500 — the API
answered 200, so even a smoke check of the endpoints would have missed it.

Asserting the file exists on disk cannot catch this, because in the repo it
always does. So this checks the packaging RULES instead: every asset under
``src/adda`` must be matched by a ``MANIFEST.in`` include line.
