"""The run's terminal state is recorded, not re-derived from its own prose.

Two bugs are pinned here, both of which logged a non-success as a validated
success because the outcome was recovered by grepping the final report's
banner and defaulting to GATED when nothing matched:

1. A backstop/repeated-errors halt. ``_halt_resumable`` wrote
   ``status="halted"``; the close path then overwrote it with the grep result,
   and the HALTED banner matches none of the patterns → GATED.
2. A critic-less graph. ``_close`` routes straight to done and emits no banner
   at all → GATED, i.e. removing the adversarial critic made every run a
   perfect success.
