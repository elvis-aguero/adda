"""A worker sees the criterion its evidence will be judged against.

A hypothesis's falsification_criterion is immutable once registered and is the
standard its verdict is judged by, but the only party adda showed it to was
the delegator, and only at reconciliation time (the falsification checkpoint
fires on a Done report). The worker that produces the evidence never saw it —
Delegate put context packaging on the delegator, so the criterion reached the
worker only if the delegator remembered to paste it.

Measured cost across 52 cluster runs: INCONCLUSIVE is the largest verdict
class (100 of 295 hypotheses) and the most expensive (median lifetime 3.15h vs
1.49h FALSIFIED, 0.91h SUPPORTED), and its comments name the mechanism — "the
registered H3 falsification criterion required a 50-iter constrained BO in the
high-Ixx region. This BO was never executed"; "Test is INADEQUATE relative to
the registered 30-point LHS criterion".
