"""Regression: a run stopped by an org-level Claude billing cap was
indistinguishable from an ordinary UNGATED close.

The Claude Code CLI backend returns a billing-cap notice as ORDINARY
assistant text (not a raised exception) — confirmed for real: a run's
strategizer turn ended with "You've hit your org's monthly spend limit ..."
as its final reply, made no further tool calls, and the run closed UNGATED
with no signal that this was an externally-caused stop rather than the
strategizer simply deciding it was done (or a real gate/science failure).
AgenticRun.execute() already supports cheap resumption via
`resume_from=<run_dir>` (test_resume.py) — the missing piece was detecting
and surfacing this specific stop condition so a user knows resuming is
appropriate. BACKLOG #34.
