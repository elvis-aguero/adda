"""Wet smoke test: the docs tutorials actually run end to end, for real.

Runs the exact problem shape taught in two docs tutorials — the Quickstart's
Branin example and Authoring a study's worked example (studies/example_study)
— through a real AgenticRun, on a free-tier OpenRouter model so this costs
nothing to run.

Marked `integration` and skipped cleanly without `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` set, so
a normal `pytest -m integration` run (no key configured) doesn't spuriously
fail. Intended trigger is the scheduled `wet_docs_smoke.yml` workflow (once
daily + manual dispatch), not the regular push/PR `Tests` workflow.

The bar this enforces is deliberately narrow: does the tutorial, followed
literally, crash? Whether the run closes GATED or UNGATED is NOT asserted —
a free/weaker model may legitimately not clear the full science gate, and
that is a model-capability signal, not a docs or runtime bug. Run this
manually with:
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY=... uv run pytest tests/test_docs_tutorials_wet.py \
        -v -s --no-cov -m integration
