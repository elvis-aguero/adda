"""The `runtime:` config block is an explicit, documented contract.

Two failure modes this file exists to prevent, both of the same kind — a
setting that silently does nothing:

1. A knob is read in the code but missing from ``KNOWN_KEYS``, so putting it
   in a study's ``config.yaml`` triggers the "unrecognised key" warning even
   though it works.
2. A knob is documented or listed but nothing reads it, so a user sets it and
   nothing happens.
