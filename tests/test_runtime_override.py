"""Explicit argument > env > config.yaml > default.

Two defects fixed here, both of which a sweep would have run straight into.

`settings._raw` checked `F3DASM_<KEY>` FIRST, ahead of everything. The docs
already say that channel "is for secrets and one-off overrides — it is not
where a study's settings belong", so the implementation contradicted the
documented intent: a stale export left in a shell beat the study's own config
and would have beaten a caller passing knobs programmatically, which for an
ablation means an arm running under a label it does not have.

And `settings` holds ONE process-global mapping installed at construction, so
building a second AgenticRun before running the first silently reconfigured it.
