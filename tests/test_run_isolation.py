"""Run-scoped state must not collide between runs.

Run ids are second-resolution timestamps, so two runs started in the same
second shared a directory outright — each overwriting the other's debug
output, ledger and status. Rare by hand; routine under a sweep, where it would
silently merge two arms into one set of files.

The study's config.yaml is also rewritten from inside a run (a guardrail that
keeps its declared output_names honest). That write is study-scope, so a
concurrently starting run can be reading it mid-truncate.
