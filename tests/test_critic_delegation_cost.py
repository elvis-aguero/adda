"""A strategizer -> critic delegation row must carry the critic's real cost.

Both critic call sites (the ``Done()`` GATE acceptance check and
``AskForFeedback``) write a delegation row, and both used to hardcode
``tokens_in=0, tokens_out=0, cost_usd=None`` on it — while the call they
represent had just spent real money, recorded only in telemetry under an
internal id (``critic-1``) that the delegation log never sees.

The consequence is a ledger that reads as complete but is not: anything
summing ``cost_usd`` across ``delegation_log.jsonl`` omits the critic's
entire budget. Measured on run 20260905T162758 — $0.697 summed from
delegations against a true $1.078, a 35% undercount, with the whole
difference being the critic.

``_invoke_critic`` now publishes the usage it already records to telemetry
as ``_last_critic_usage`` for its caller to put on the row.
