"""Labelled queries for an agent-facing index of adda's OWN source.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, AND WHY IT EXISTS FIRST
    The proposal is a lookup tool over adda's source — the same shape as
    ``knowledge/f3dasm_api.py``, pointed at this package instead of f3dasm.
    Written after the tool, a query set measures whatever the tool already
    does. Written before it, it is the thing the tool has to satisfy. The
    alias map in ``f3dasm_api`` is the cautionary case: 84 hand-written
    English->f3dasm pairs, added once the misses were known, which is an
    answer fitted to its own test.

    So these 45 queries are written against the QUESTION, not against any
    implementation. Nothing here may be edited to accommodate a retriever.
    Fixing a label because a tool missed it is the failure mode this file is
    supposed to prevent.

THE BASELINE IS RIPGREP, NOT NOTHING
    A coding agent with a shell already reads a 31k-line repo. The honest
    control is ``rg -i <the query's own words> src/``, scored the same way.
    A tier where the index does not beat that control is a tier where the
    index should not ship.

THE HELD-OUT SPLIT
    ``DEVELOPMENT`` (31) may be looked at while building. ``HELD_OUT`` (14)
    may not be read, reasoned about, or scored until the design is frozen.
    They are stratified by tier so the held-out set is not accidentally the
    easy third.

WHAT A GOLD ANSWER IS
    The file(s) a correct answer must name. Where more than one is listed,
    ANY of them at rank 1 counts as a hit: "where does a run decide it is
    over" is answered by ``runtime/terminal.py`` alone, but "how does it stop
    an agent inventing results" is genuinely two places and a retriever that
    names either has answered it.

    Paths are repository-relative. ``tests/test_adda_source_queries.py``
    asserts every one of them still exists, so a rename cannot rot this set
    into a silently-passing one.
