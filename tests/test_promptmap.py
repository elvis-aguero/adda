"""The prompt/gate provenance map must keep telling the truth.

``internal/tools/promptmap.py`` renders a map that cites, for every piece of
text an agent sees and every gate that can stop it, an exact ``file:line``.
Such a map is only worth anything if a stale one FAILS rather than quietly
citing code that moved. These tests are that failure:

* every gate symbol in the registry still resolves (the generator raises
  ``SystemExit`` when one does not);
* every section of every assembled prompt still resolves to a real file and
  a line inside it — so a prompt that moves takes its citation along;
* the Done() sequence is still parsed out of ``feedback.py``'s own tuple
  rather than hand-listed.

No network, no model, no API cost: everything is read off the live graph
objects and the AST.
