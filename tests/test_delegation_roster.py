"""The strategizer is told which agents EXIST, from the live graph.

A campaign on a 2- and 3-node graph logged 17 delegations to agents that were
not wired: 15 to 'implementer', 2 to 'literature_reviewer'. The cause was not
the resolver — ``resolve_target`` matches by live node name then role, and the
failure message already prints ``Valid targets: {node._outgoing}``. It was the
static prompt.

That prompt is written against the full cast, and it was careful about most of
it: the literature-reviewer and datagenerator routes are both qualified "WHEN
PRESENT", and the agent is told to take exact names from the Delegate hints.
But it also designated a FALLBACK, unconditionally — "if no specialist matches
a block, the general implementer handles it" — and routed blocks 2-4, the bulk
of the work, to "the implementer role" with no qualifier. In a graph with no
implementer that is a guaranteed miss on almost every delegation, which is why
one name accounts for 15 of the 17 and the qualified roles for 2.

So the fix is topology, not emphasis: the run's real roster is generated into
the prompt, and the prose stops asserting that any particular agent exists.
