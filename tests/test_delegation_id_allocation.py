"""A milestone-blocked delegation must NOT burn a delegation ID.

next_id() advances a monotonic counter on every call; it used to be called at
the top of Delegate(), before the milestone gate, so a blocked implementer
attempt consumed an ID that never reached the log — leaving a permanent gap in
the sequence (the always-present early MILESTONE_BLOCK reliably ate "D002").
The fix moves allocation to AFTER the gate; this pins it.
