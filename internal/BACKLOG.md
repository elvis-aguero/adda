# Agentic system — backlog

**Open work only.** Resolved items keep their full write-up in
[`BACKLOG_RESOLVED.md`](BACKLOG_RESOLVED.md) — the record survives, it just stops
crowding out what still needs doing.

Item numbers are stable references, never queue positions. Detailed,
evidence-grounded specs live in [`specs/`](specs/README.md); the entries here are
the short version.

## How to read this

Three groups, because they need three different things from you:

| Group | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Awaiting your decision (§4)** | Already escalated. The work is understood; the *call* is yours. Not a new discovery — do not re-surface these as findings. |
| **Actionable** | Someone can pick this up and do it without asking anything first. |
| **Parked** | Deliberately deferred. No action expected; here so it is not rediscovered. |

---

## Awaiting your decision — CLAUDE.md §4

These are blocked on a judgment call, not on effort. Each has been surfaced
before. Until one is answered or closed, treat it as known, not news.

- [ ] **#10** Strategizer delegates the optimization as one monolithic un-budgeted campaign — *open, §4 user-owned* (**current binding constraint** — watchdog-kills runs)
- [ ] **#17** Closure + budget-severity model (Memory>Time>Eval; dynamic constraints) — *open, §4 user-owned* — Done() prompt iterated (`0400a653`); runtime nudge + severity model deferred
- [ ] **#19** Scientific adequacy is enforced as vibes while reproduction is enforced hard — *§4, partially addressed (`8ae9a402`, `93e6f0f2`); the load-bearing question is OPEN and empirical* — see §19 below
- [ ] **#18** Critic should flag an infeasible-extremum headline on a constrained study — *open, §4 user-owned* — grounding moved to the critic (`6494489b`) but it only checks the value is real, not feasible

## Actionable

- [ ] **#1** Reconcile cancelled-but-completed delegations — *open, highest priority* (recurring UNGATED root cause; partially mitigated 2026-06-15)
- [ ] **#6** Detect a delegation running but making zero ledger progress — *open*
- [ ] **#22** Stall watchdog: liveness = "file written", not "progress made" — *open, medium (a backstop, not a primary control)*. `seconds_since_last_activity()` (`infra/watchdog_cleanup.py`) is implemented exactly as this item describes and its docstring defends the choice; whether a busy-but-unproductive run should be caught is still unanswered — see §22 below. Note: `python -m adda.watchdog` (#41, resolved — see `internal/BACKLOG_RESOLVED.md`) is a flat 2×-budget hard deadline and deliberately does NOT consult this liveness signal, so this item is still genuinely open and independent of #41's fix.
- [ ] **#16** ABAQUS subprocess can't import workspace modules (PYTHONPATH) — *open, abaqus2py-owned* (recommendation only; not an f3dasm fix)

## Parked — deferred on purpose

- [ ] **#2** Richer delegator↔worker comms (typed blocker/escalation) — *deferred*
- [ ] **#3** ProblemDefinerAgent pre-strategizer intake stage — *deferred*
- [ ] **#20** Open design-space discovery (agent invents new low-D parametrizations) — *spec approved, §4 user-owned, awaiting 2D experiment* — see [`OPEN_DESIGN_SPACE_FRAMEWORK.md`](OPEN_DESIGN_SPACE_FRAMEWORK.md); branch `exp/open-design-space`
- [ ] **#23** Rename `literature_reviewer` → `consultant` + give it live-web tools so it answers tech-stack/API/doc questions, not only academic literature — *spec, not built (user decision 2026-06-30)* — see §23 below

## 10. Strategizer delegates the optimization as ONE monolithic, un-budgeted campaign
**Status:** PARTIALLY MITIGATED 2026-06-22 (commit pending) — added a "scope each
delegation to one hypothesis" principle to the strategizer planning prompt
(`<scientific_process>`), grounded in Charter §3 (bundling confounds the test) with
a fail-fast/self-correct rationale. This NUDGES toward targeted campaigns but is not
enforced — the strategizer already ignored a sharper signal (H1's explicit 300-eval
criterion), so it likely needs the #9-family check to truly bind, and the wall-clock/
algorithm half (uncapped GP × 700 iters, non-resumable re-run) is untouched. Stays open.
**Status (orig):** raised 2026-06-22 (run 20260622T165943 watchdog post-mortem). **§4 — budget/decomposition, user-owned.** The recurring binding constraint once upstream phases are clean.

The strategizer delegates the WHOLE optimization to one implementer call. Verbatim
intent (D004): "Execute a comprehensive 1000-eval black-box minimization campaign …
PHASE 1 LHS 250 … PHASE 2 BO loop ~700 evals … PHASE 3 multi-start 50". Its thinking:
"Now I'll delegate to the implementer to execute the full campaign … fairly
open-ended." No wall-clock budgeting, no chunking (it does NOT delegate Phase 1,
check the budget, then Phase 2). The implementer runs it as a monolithic background
script (optimize_1000eval.py) whose GP-surrogate BO loop is O(n³) per refit over 700
iterations — inherently slow. Result: ~41 min, 673/1000 evals, never finished, watchdog.

**KPI contrast (the tell):** run 20260622T043904 GATED with ~996 evals in **22 min**;
run 20260622T050137 GATED with 2570 evals in 49 min. So a ~1000-eval campaign CAN fit
and gate — the failure is per-eval SLOWNESS (heavy GP-BO refits) + a no-chunk, no-time-
budget delegation, not the eval count itself.

**Classification:** JUDGMENT CALL, not a bug — a reasonable agent following the spec
(pipeline = LHS→GP→BO→optimization; implementer is "the only agent that evaluates")
would delegate "the campaign". But the system gives the strategizer no wall-clock
signal and no incentive to chunk. The implementer's own retrospective even claims an
"~18-min allocation" while the campaign needed 41 — a budget-estimate mismatch.

**Resume-cold options (user's call):** (a) strategizer chunks the campaign (delegate a
bounded slice, check budget/ledger, delegate the next) so it can gate mid-way; (b) give
the implementer a wall-clock-aware budget that caps the campaign and returns partial
results; (c) cheaper default surrogate/acquisition (the slowness is GP-refit cost); (d)
raise the 3600s watchdog. Do NOT pick without the user — budget is soft by charter.

## 17. Closure decoupled from success-criteria + budget; budget-severity model — §4

**Status: open, §4 user-owned. Partially addressed.** Run `20260624T021359` closed
at ~22% of a 12h budget with its PRIMARY success criterion (Stage-2 Riks
`max_strain ≥ 0.90`) left INCONCLUSIVE and the affordable settling experiment (a
refined Riks re-run) never delegated. Root: a three-way gap — the strategizer prompt
made Done() eligible on "best design + one falsification attempt" (no criteria-met
notion), budget reached the agent only as a 95%/100% *brake* (never as runway,
`strategizer.py` budget warnings), Done() is budget-blind (`routing.py`), and the
critic is *forbidden* to weigh budget ("RESOURCE BOOKKEEPING IS NOT VALIDITY",
`agents/critic.py`) and is not scoped to closure timing.

**Done (`0400a653`):** the strategizer PREMATURE CONVERGENCE rule now requires
primary criteria MET (not merely tested), frames budget as runway, and asks for a
recorded reason when closing early; mirrored in the Done() docstring.

**Deferred (the open §4 design question):** a *runtime* closure nudge (soft — a
two-shot reconsider when closing with large budget unused and a criterion
unmet/INCONCLUSIVE, mirroring the 95% wind-down nudge), and a **budget-severity
model**. The user's framing: budgets differ in severity — roughly **Memory > Time >
Eval** — and *accidental* constraints (e.g. a Riks `max_strain` gate) are
**dynamically assigned**, so they should receive *differentiated* treatment rather
than one uniform nudge. How to represent constraint severity/type and key the nudge
on it is unresolved. The benchmark `PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md` framing (objective excludes
strain; Riks demoted to a separate "Validation requirement"; criterion #4 buried)
contributed and is owned by the user (handled in the benchmark repo, not f3dasm —
robustness must not depend on a perfectly-framed problem statement).

## 19. Scientific adequacy is enforced as vibes while reproduction is enforced hard — §4

**Status: partially addressed (`8ae9a402`, `93e6f0f2`); the load-bearing question
is OPEN and empirical.** Diagnosis from run `20260625T014520` (supercompressible
14D). Numbers (faithful): 257 evals, 47 coilable (~18% feasible), exactly **1**
above the Bessa baseline (66.04 vs 65.3, a 1.1% edge), **0** above the +15% floor
(75.1). Closed voluntarily at 3 h 36 m wall (not watchdog-killed). The deliverable
declared "66.04 … represents the effective performance ceiling in this design
space" (H6 cell) and H4 FALSIFIED.

**The failure (established):** a synthesis-level over-generalisation. The run
converted "my underpowered search did not clear the floor" into "the 14D space
cannot." Its OWN deliverable documents the search as weak — ml cell: "CV R² ≈ 0.51
on 27 coilable points"; doe cell cites Loeppky 2009 "≥10×d" (=140) then uses 50;
D005 retrospective: GP length-scale pinned at bound 1000, "poorly tuned." The BO's
feasible hit-rate (3/37 ≈ 8%) was *worse* than the LHS (18%). The whole campaign
was pre-committed to a narrow box (`ratio_Ixx ∈ [5e-7,1.4e-6]`, `phase2_plan.md`)
derived from a 1-D scaling formula **before** the first LHS returned — so 14D was
never broadly explored; a physics-intuition ray was.

**Mechanism (established by reading the code):**
- The Charter's §2 severity rule IS present and IS applied — but only
  **per-hypothesis**. H4's registered prediction was scoped to "this search finds
  ≥75.1," so FALSIFIED is charter-legal. The over-reach lives in the **synthesised
  prose**, which no registered hypothesis covers.
- The live `verdict_validator.py` shares ONLY the Charter (not the critic's
  checklist) and judges ONE hypothesis verdict at a time — it is **structurally
  blind to the synthesis**.
- Both critic calls (`call_001` REVISE, `call_002` PASS) spent 100% on
  reproduction mechanics (composable BO, lazy guard, IN_PROGRESS jobs); neither
  engaged criteria 2/3/4 against the headline. The critic prompt’s criterion 6 was
  marked "binding" and its prose equated "scientific integrity" with "provenance +
  replicability", steering attention there. The gate proved the notebook
  *reproduces*, never that the science was *sound* (CLAUDE.md §4.5).
- Budget cost-prior: planned ~72 sims for 14D on an unverified ~600 s/sim
  assumption; measured median was 16.4 s (36.5x off), never recalibrated.

**Done this session (general principles, not patches — each passes the parsimony
test):**
- `8ae9a402` — Charter §2 extended so an achievement/absence claim ("some/no
  design reaches X") is adequately tested only if the search had the POWER to find
  the instance (coverage + a surrogate above chance); a stalled search →
  INCONCLUSIVE. Lives in the Charter, so the gate critic AND the live validator
  inherit it (the validator can now flag a premature FALSIFIED **on the fly at
  HypothesisUpdate**). Critic criterion 4 made CRITICAL-eligible for whole-space
  headlines; criterion-6 "integrity = reproduction" sentence corrected to
  "necessary but not sufficient." Strategizer PREMATURE CONVERGENCE: a stalled
  optimizer/plateau is NOT a valid "budget can't settle it" reason.
- `93e6f0f2` — per-delegation wall-time KPIs auto-appended to the report (attacks
  the cost-prior; interpretation-free to avoid overfitting).

**OPEN — the empirical question these edits do NOT answer.** Whether the failure
is *scaffold* (the harness graded reproduction, so the model optimized it) or
*model disposition* (commercial LLMs fine-tuned to terminate with a confident
answer, antagonistic to staying INCONCLUSIVE) is **unresolved and untested**. The
edits are an intervention, not a proven fix. Decisive test (one run): re-run this
study with `8ae9a402`+`93e6f0f2` live — if the agent stays INCONCLUSIVE / keeps
exploring, or the validator/critic flags the ceiling claim → scaffold; if it still
manufactures a confident ceiling → disposition. Do NOT record these edits as
"fixed" until that run exists. Note in favour of scaffold (not proof): the same
agent marked H5 INCONCLUSIVE correctly, so the capability is present.

**OPEN — structural gap (§4, user-owned).** The synthesis-level over-claim is
reachable only by the critic (criterion 4); the validator cannot see it because it
judges one hypothesis verdict at a time. Widening the validator's scope to the
synthesised headline — so it can catch this on the fly rather than at Done() — is
an architectural change the user owns. Related: #18 (critic blind to
infeasible-extremum headlines) and #17 (budget-severity model) are the same class
— the critic/validator scrutinise mechanics and atomic verdicts, not the headline
as a communicated scientific claim.

---

## 18. Critic should flag an infeasible-extremum headline on a constrained study — §4

**Status: open, §4 user-owned.** Commit `6494489b` removed the runtime
`REPRODUCED` extremum machine-check (it forced constrained studies to headline
their infeasible unconstrained extremum) and shifted headline grounding onto the
critic. But the critic's HEADLINE PROVENANCE mandate (`agents/critic.py:31-41`)
only verifies the headline value is **real** (traces to a ledger row) — it does
NOT verify the headline is **feasible**. So nothing currently flags the specific
failure of run 20260624T021359: a headline equal to the unconstrained extremum
(λ_cr_nd = 0.90709, a NON-coilable design) on a study whose objective is
`maximize λ_cr_nd subject to coilable = True`.

**Proposed (one clause, §4):** add to the critic's headline check that, when the
study declares a feasibility constraint (a constraint output column), the headline
must be the best **feasible** design; a headline equal to an infeasible extremum
is a MAJOR finding. The constraint identity could come from
run_config (an explicit constraint column) or be inferred from the deliverable's
stated objective. Deferred pending the user's call on how to represent the
constraint to the critic (it is the epistemic-contract owner's decision).

**Why not the runtime instead:** the runtime can't judge which ledger column is
the constraint or what counts as feasible generically without more config; the
critic already reads the deliverable's stated objective, so it is the better
place to judge feasibility-of-headline. See `6494489b` and `agents/critic.py`.

## 1. Reconcile cancelled-but-completed delegations
**Status:** partially mitigated 2026-06-15 (cancel hardened + eval-count now
from ledger); the core inconsistency remains. **Highest priority** — it is the
recurring root cause of UNGATED / hypotheses-left-OPEN outcomes across runs.

`CancelDelegation` detaches a worker and tells the strategizer "result will be
ignored," but the **detached worker keeps running**, finishes, stamps real evals
into the canonical ledger, and writes its report to disk. The run then holds two
contradictory truths: the official record (delegation_log / registry / what the
strategizer is told) says *ignored / not executed*, while the ledger + on-disk
report say *done*. Primary evidence (run 20260615T192313): D005/D006 were
cancelled-detached, absent from delegation_log, yet have 145/32 ledgered evals +
`D006/REPORT_SUMMARY.txt` ("H1 SUPPORTED"). The strategizer then claimed "the
falsification was not executed" (per the runtime's "ignore it") while the critic
read the disk report — a **non-converging gate loop** rooted in inconsistent
state, NOT agent hallucination or prompt friction. Re-confirmed 2026-06-16: the
8d e2e left H1/H2 OPEN citing "D004 cancelled post-completion."

**Done so far:** (a) `evals_used` now counts from the ledger so those evals
aren't dropped from the run total (`agent_runtime.py`); (b) cancel is hardened
against impatience — two-shot for delegations already producing ledgered evals;
docstring + poll/premature nudges reframed (`routing.py`).

**Still to design:** when a detached worker completes with stamped ledger rows,
**reconcile** it — record its completion in the delegation_log (so the
strategizer sees it finished, not "ignored"), or stop the worker BEFORE it
stamps. Pick one source of truth so strategizer and critic never see
contradictory delegation state. Related: the stuck-delegation detection in #6.

---

## 6. Detect a delegation that is running but making zero ledger progress
**Status:** raised 2026-06-16. Cross-links #1 (reconcile) and #2 (steering levers).

A delegation can be **alive but unproductive**: the worker is still `Working`,
wall-time is climbing, but it is stamping **zero new rows** into the canonical
ledger. Today the strategizer cannot tell "slow but progressing" from "stuck /
spinning," so it polls, then either waits until the time budget dies or cancels
on impatience (feeding #1). Primary evidence (run 20260616T004655): the
implementer (D004) was alive ~228s+ yet produced **0 ledgered evals**; the run
ended UNGATED with an empty ledger.

**The signal:** status == Working AND wall-time since last ledger row > threshold
AND ledger delta == 0. That is detectable from the same `RunStateSummary` /
delegation timing the runtime already tracks. Surface it to the strategizer as a
distinct notice ("D004 has run 200s with no ledger progress") rather than letting
it guess from poll counts.

**Then it needs a lever, not just a notice** — which is exactly the typed
delegator decisions in #2 (`grant_budget` if it's genuinely close, `reroute` or
`abort` if it's stuck). Without #2 the only response is still the blunt
`CancelDelegation`. So #6 is the *detector*; #2 supplies the *actuators*; #1
ensures whatever the worker already stamped is reconciled rather than orphaned.

**Open question:** the threshold — fixed seconds, a fraction of the time budget,
or adaptive to the worker's own first-row latency? A cheap robust default: warn
once past max(120s, 15% of budget) with no row, escalate past 2× that.

---

## 22. Stall watchdog: liveness = "file written", not "progress made" (backstop defect)

**Severity:** medium (a backstop, not a primary control — the real cure for the
hang it failed to bound is the per-call validator timeout, shipped in `9d58b2a3`).

**What happened.** Run `20260627T211310` (watchdog_killed, 2h20m). A verdict-validator
LLM call hung at 22:03:29 (see `9d58b2a3` for the root cause). The study's stall
watchdog (`studies/agentic_namespace_ring/run.py` `_watchdog`, using
`watchdog_cleanup.seconds_since_last_activity`) is supposed to force-exit a hung run
after `STALL_SECONDS` (1200s here). It did fire — but only at **idle 5378s (~89 min)**,
~4.5× its own threshold. The watchdog post-mortem records `force-killed at 5378s`.

**Suspected cause (UNCONFIRMED — snapshot mtimes corrupted by the batch's non-`-p`
cp, so not provable from preserved artifacts):** `seconds_since_last_activity` =
most-recent mtime of ANY file under the run dir. Liveness so defined is satisfied by
a hung-but-still-twitching CLI subprocess (partial transcript flushes, checkpoint WAL,
telemetry) — i.e. *activity ≠ progress*. A run can write bytes while making zero
scientific progress, resetting the idle clock. (Alternative: daemon-thread starvation
under a GIL-holding loop — also unproven.)

**Proposed fix (deferred — the user flagged the watchdog as a SYMPTOM; do not
re-prioritise it over root causes):** define "stall" as *no PROGRESS* — no new ledgered
evaluations and no delegation state-transition for the window — rather than *no file
written*. Catches both a true hang and a grind-without-progress, and never kills a run
that is still producing evals (honours "never penalise parallel/slow-but-live work").
Needs a progress signal the watchdog can read cheaply (e.g. max over ledger row count +
delegation_log completed count). Validate headless before trusting it.

**Why not now:** with the validator call bounded (`9d58b2a3`), the specific hang that
exposed this can no longer run 89 min — it aborts in ~2 min. The watchdog defect only
matters for a *different*, not-yet-observed hang that the per-call timeouts don't cover.
Fix it when such a case appears, or as deliberate hardening — not as symptom-chasing.

---

## 16. ABAQUS subprocess can't import workspace modules (PYTHONPATH) — abaqus2py-owned

**Status: open — recommendation only (not an f3dasm fix).** During run
`20260624T021359`, all 51 ABAQUS runs of the first D003 attempt failed with
`ImportError: No module named 'supercompressible_lin_buckle_param'`: the workspace
dir was not on `PYTHONPATH` when the ABAQUS subprocess ran (it worked in validation
only because a validate script did `sys.path.insert(0, WORKSPACE)`). This also
contaminated the canonical store with 51 NEW-status rows that had to be cleared
before D004 (meta_errors.md Bug 1).

**Owner: the external `abaqus2py` package**, not f3dasm — `F3DASMAbaqusSimulator`
(which generates the `preprocess.py` wrapper and launches ABAQUS) is imported from
`abaqus2py` (`studies/fragile_becomes_supercompressible/main.py`), which is not in
this repo. **Recommended fix (in abaqus2py):** inject the workspace dir into the
ABAQUS subprocess environment (`PYTHONPATH`) or emit `sys.path.insert(0, WORKSPACE)`
into the generated `preprocess.py`, so worker-authored param modules resolve without
relying on the parent process's cwd/sys.path.

## 2. Richer delegator↔worker comms — typed blocker/escalation
**Status:** deferred (prefer benchmarking the current system first). Design explored 2026-06-15.

**Today:** the protocol is near single-shot — `Delegate(task, expected_report, …)`
down, the worker's structured report up, and exactly **one blocking
`FollowUp(question)` clarification** mid-task (≤1 per delegation; routes to the
delegating agent — or the human for the entry node). When no operator/TTY is
present FollowUp now returns an autonomous-proceed notice instead of blocking
(headless `input()` EOFError fixed 2026-06-16). The delegator can only
`CancelDelegation` a running worker — it **cannot steer** one.

**Principle:** a *blocker* differs from a *clarification* on **who must act** —
a clarification needs information back; a blocker needs the delegator to take an
**action** the worker can't take itself. So the fix is not "let the worker ask
more," it's "give the delegator the right levers." The real levers a blocked
worker needs: **provide** a missing input/capability, **grant** more eval
budget, **revise** scope, **reroute** to another specialist, **abort** cleanly.

**Chosen direction (Approach A + C's logging):** a worker tool `Escalate(blocker,
kind)` distinct from `FollowUp` — `kind ∈ {missing_input, over_budget,
capability_gap, scope_conflict, unrecoverable}` — that *blocks* (reuse the
FollowUp wait/Reply plumbing) and the delegator answers with a **typed
decision** (`provide / grant_budget(n) / revise_scope / reroute(target) /
abort`) that the runtime *applies* (budget bump, clean abort, re-delegation).
Log the escalation + its resolution to the delegation log (auditable, fits the
science-integrity ethos). These same `abort`/`grant_budget`/`reroute` levers are
what the strategizer needs to act on the stuck-delegation signal in #6.

**Open question to settle first:** which of the 5 delegator actions earn their
place vs YAGNI?

---

## 3. ProblemDefinerAgent — a pre-strategizer intake stage
**Status:** deferred. Raised 2026-06-16.

A new agent that sits **between the human and the strategizer**, running once at
the very start of a run, before the strategizer takes over. Its job is to turn a
raw human problem statement into a high-signal, airtight brief so the strategizer
spends its budget on science, not on plumbing/ambiguity.

**Responsibilities:**
- **(a) Airtight problem statement** — resolve ambiguity, pin the objective
  (minimise/maximise), constraints, success criterion, and what "the result"
  is. Today this is partly covered by the advisory `_review_problem_statement`
  pre-run pass (`agent_runtime.py:680`); the ProblemDefiner would *own* and
  extend it (interactive with the human, not just advisory).
- **(b) Tech stack + ExperimentData schema** — decide/confirm the f3dasm Domain
  (input variables + bounds + types) and the **output columns** of the canonical
  ExperimentData (objective col name, feasibility cols, units), so the ledger
  schema is fixed before any delegation runs.
- **(c) Hard-to-automate plumbing** — the evaluator entrypoint, eval/wall
  budgets, output_names, any study-specific config that today lives in
  `config.yaml` / `PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md` and is easy to get subtly wrong.

**Why:** it **offloads the strategizer** (which currently has to infer schema,
reconcile config vs problem statement, and self-review well-posedness) and hands
it a higher-quality signal. Net effect: fewer SCIENCE_DRIFT / MILESTONE_BLOCK
diagnostics traceable to an under-specified brief, and a fixed ledger schema from
turn one.

**To design when picked up:** is it a graph node (entry before strategizer) or a
runtime pre-pass like the current problem-statement review? How interactive with
the human (blocking Q&A vs one-shot)? Does it *write* `config.yaml` + an enriched
`PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md` as its output artifacts (so the brief is itself a
reproducible deliverable)? Relationship to the existing
`_review_problem_statement` advisory pass (replace vs wrap).

---

## 23. `consultant` — broaden the literature_reviewer into a research+docs consultant

**Status:** spec only; NOT built (user decision 2026-06-30: "one agent, general
but sharp … spec it and put it on the backlog"). Name decided: **`consultant`**.

**Motivation (evidence).** Run `20260629T191754` (supercompressible-material-
creative) shows the datagenerator/implementer repeatedly brute-forcing live
tech-stack gotchas with no doc-lookup channel: `.fil` vs `.odb` for Abaqus
`*IMPERFECTION` (D007), `max_waiting_time=60` too short for Riks preprocessing
(D007), `except RuntimeError` not catching `CalledProcessError`/`TimeoutError`
(D003), `data.add()` not existing on `ExperimentData` (D003), store ordering by
completion time (D004). Each is a documentation question the agents could not
ask anyone — the literature_reviewer can only search *academic papers*
(Corpus/Semantic Scholar/OpenAlex/arXiv), not Abaqus or Python docs.

**Current state (the channel already exists — this is mostly capability+prompt,
not topology).**
- `agents/_graphs.py` already wires `datagenerator → literature_reviewer` and
  `implementer → literature_reviewer`, and `agents/datagenerator.py` already
  instructs `Delegate(target="literature_reviewer", …)`.
- BUT `agents/datagenerator.py:48` says *"Delegate for methodology, not for
  Python syntax"* — the exact opposite of consulting for an API gotcha.
- AND `agents/literature.py` has **no** general-web tool (no WebSearch/WebFetch);
  its toolset is academic-paper search only.

**Proposed changes (one agent, two modes — "general but sharp").**
1. **Add `WebSearch` + `WebFetch`** to the agent (general web covers Abaqus,
   Python, any tech stack — no per-tool MCP needed). FEATURES.md entry required
   in the same commit (tool catalog is enforced by
   `tests/test_features_documented.py`).
2. **Flip the guidance** in `agents/datagenerator.py` (and the implementer) so
   workers may consult for tooling/API/doc questions, not just methodology.
3. **Rename** `literature_reviewer` → `consultant` everywhere: the agent class
   `role`, the node name + edges in `_graphs.py`, every prompt reference
   (strategizer/datagenerator/implementer/critic), the KB-menu audience filter,
   and the milestone/gate text that special-cases `literature_reviewer` (e.g.
   `milestones.py` "literature_reviewer is never gated" and its tests). This is
   the bulk of the mechanical churn — grep `literature_reviewer` across `src/`
   and `tests/` first; ~dozens of sites.
4. **Two-mode prompt (the one real risk).** The current prompt is science-
   citation-heavy (corpus, falsification support). A doc lookup needs *different*
   rigor — the right answer + a source URL, fast — not a literature synthesis.
   The prompt must explicitly distinguish: (a) *literature mode* (academic claim
   → cite a paper from the corpus) vs (b) *docs mode* (API/tooling question →
   authoritative doc/source URL, concise). Without this the agent will
   over-academicize a one-line API question.

**Scope guard.** One agent, not a split — the web tools serve both modes and a
second node is churn without evidence the roles conflict. Revisit only if a run
shows the two modes degrading each other.

**Not §4.** This is agent capability/tooling + prompt, not science epistemics —
no science_monitor / charter / critic-criteria / budget change. Build under the
normal contract (headless test first: assert the renamed node + edges resolve,
the new tools appear in the catalog, and both preamble/guidance render; e2e
behavior-only last).
