## A. Science & orchestration

### Hypothesis ledger
- **What:** the run's record of falsifiable hypotheses and their verdicts (OPEN /
  SUPPORTED / FALSIFIED / INCONCLUSIVE), append-only.
- **Where:** `hypothesis_ledger.py`; the strategizer's mutate closures
  (`HypothesisPropose`/`HypothesisUpdate`/`LinkFalsificationAttempt`) in
  `nodes/tools/routing/ledger.py`; per-run file `debug/strategizer_notes/hypotheses.json`.
- **Status:** core.

### Falsification charter (the Popperian rules)
- **What:** the single binding text defining how a hypothesis may be tested and
  labelled (severity of the attempt, verdict follows the result, no goalpost-moving).
- **Why:** one shared standard both the strategizer and the critic cite.
- **Where:** `knowledge/charter.py`. **Status:** core (§4 user-owned).

### Live verdict validator (#9)
- **What:** when a hypothesis is closed, an independent referee checks — *live* —
  that the verdict obeys the charter, and nudges the strategizer if not.
- **Why:** the gate critic only checks at the end; this catches charter violations
  at the moment of assertion.
- **Where:** `verdict_validator.py` (judge logic); invoked by `nodes/tools/routing/ledger.py`
  HypothesisUpdate via `node._run_verdict_validator`, which is defined in
  `nodes/critic_gate.py`. Runs on the **critic's** model (reuses the critic adapter),
  not the strategizer's — one refereeing standard, decoupled from the agent it judges.
- **Memory (anti-oscillation):** the judge is fed its own prior rulings on the SAME
  hypothesis (from the ledger `status_log`, via `_prior_rulings_digest`) with a
  justify-any-reversal guard, so a borderline verdict can't silently flip between
  calls. Mirrors the gate critic's prior-reviews digest.
- **Bounded budget:** the advisory call runs with a tight `idle_timeout=120s` +
  `retry_max=1` (NOT the run-wide 5×600s agent-turn budget). A hung CLI stream once
  froze a whole run for ~89 min here; on any timeout/failure the verdict simply
  stands (the call is advisory).
- **Config:** kill switch `F3DASM_VERDICT_VALIDATOR=0`. **Status:** advisory, non-blocking.

### Science monitor
- **What:** background rules that flag scientific drift and escalate repeated
  drift to the critic. Two provenance-integrity rules bracket the eval ledger
  from both directions: **UNLEDGERED_EVALS** (a delegation reported evals but
  wrote no attributable rows — evals that never reached the store) and
  **UNSTAMPED_ROWS** (the store gained rows with no provenance owner — the
  reverse: rows written outside get_evaluator() via the public
  ExperimentData.store() door, neither counted nor reproducible). Both warn-only.
  A third rule, **DUPLICATE_EVALUATION**, flags a delegation re-evaluating a
  design point already FINISHED, unchanged, in the ledger (real incident: a
  delegation re-sampled an identical seed=42 LHS design three times, 122 of
  160 rows pure waste — backlog #24). Counter-based, not level-triggered: fires
  once 3 NEW duplicate rows land since the last check, then resets; capped at
  2 nudges per delegation; rate-limited to one per 60s. `Wait()`'s poll loop
  also drains the monitor on every 10s tick (not just on the next tool call),
  so a nudge reaches a strategizer blocked waiting on a live campaign instead
  of surfacing only after the whole delegation (and its budget) is spent.
  **DUPLICATE_EVALUATION is now also PREVENTED, not only detected:**
  `InstrumentedDataGenerator._flush` dedups on write — a buffered eval whose
  design (same rounded input coords, per-delegation, the detector's own key) is
  already in the store, or repeats within the batch, is dropped keep-first (an
  existing FINISHED row is never mutated) and logged as `DEDUP_SKIPPED`. This
  ends the retry/re-launch duplication that burned ~30h of eval wall-time on 2
  designs in run 20260715T191329. Per-delegation scope preserves legitimate
  cross-delegation concurrent evals. Correcting a stale/wrong FINISHED row (e.g.
  a pre-oracle-fix drift read) is the explicit opt-in `InstrumentedDataGenerator.
  supersede(sample)` — re-runs the oracle and REPLACES that design's row
  net-count-preservingly (old out, new in = same count, FINISHED preserved), so
  the PROTECTED-store shrink/regression guard still holds; reachable by agents as
  `get_evaluator().supersede(sample)`. The ledger is append-only otherwise.
- **Where:** `science_monitor.py` (`_check_unledgered`, `_check_unstamped_rows`,
  `_check_duplicate_evaluations`); `ledger_summary.py` `unstamped_row_count`,
  `duplicate_eval_stats`; `routing.py` `Wait()`. **Status:** core (§4 user-owned).

### Registered criterion reaches the worker (pre-registration the experimenter can read)
- **What:** when `Delegate` carries `hypothesis_ids`, the worker's task message
  gains a `<registered_hypothesis>` block built from the ledger: each
  hypothesis's statement (capped at 700 chars — context) plus its
  `falsification_criterion` and `prediction` **verbatim, never truncated**
  (the contract). With `is_falsification_attempt=True` the framing states that
  the evidence will be judged against those criteria exactly as written, and
  explicitly licenses reporting a mismatch instead of substituting a
  different test.
- **Where:** `nodes/tools/routing/` `_hypothesis_brief()`, injected in
  `Delegate`'s task assembly beside the constraint snapshot.
- **Why:** the criterion is immutable once registered and is the standard the
  verdict is judged by, but the only party adda showed it to was the
  delegator, and only at reconciliation time — `_falsification_checkpoint()`
  fires on a **Done** report, i.e. after the evidence exists. `Delegate`'s
  contract put context packaging on the delegator, so the worker saw the
  criterion only if the delegator remembered to paste it. Measured cost across
  52 cluster runs: INCONCLUSIVE is the largest verdict class (100 of 295
  hypotheses) and the most expensive (median lifetime 3.15h vs 1.49h
  FALSIFIED, 0.91h SUPPORTED, 45% resolving within an hour of the run ending),
  and its verdict comments name the mechanism — *"the registered H3
  falsification criterion required a 50-iter constrained BO in the high-Ixx
  region. This BO was never executed"*; *"Test is INADEQUATE relative to the
  registered 30-point LHS criterion"*. Fixed in code rather than by another
  prompt rule because the corpus already asks for this
  (`agents/strategizer.py` tells the strategizer to pre-commit the sampling
  plan and eval count **in** the criterion) and it did not take — §2's stated
  fallback is a guard at the tool boundary.
- **Note:** `Delegate` already refuses unknown `hypothesis_ids` outright, so
  the brief is never built from a dangling reference.
- **Status:** core.

### Process milestones
- **What:** a small backlog (assess-literature, oracle-ready, …) that gates the
  implementer until the strategizer resolves each (complete or skip).
- **Where:** `milestones.py`; the `Milestone*` tools in `nodes/tools/routing/ledger.py`.
  **Status:** core.

### Delegation + inter-agent messaging
- **What:** the strategizer delegates work to specialist agents and they report back;
  agents can ask one clarifying question, send async messages, and report progress.
- **Where:** `nodes/tools/routing/`, `nodes/orchestration.py`.
- **Tools:** `Delegate`*, `GetStatus`, `Wait`, `FollowUp`, `Confer`, `ReportEvals`.
  (*Delegate is injected dynamically, not in a static `tools` set.)
- **Fan-out harvesting:** `Wait()` takes an OPTIONAL delegation id. Bare
  `Wait()` blocks until whichever delegation finishes first and returns that
  one's report (labelled with its ID), marking it read so N in flight are
  drained by N calls; it refuses when nothing is in flight, and refuses rather
  than hanging when every open delegation is parked on a `FollowUp` or has
  already died without reporting (a blocking call ends no turn, so the run's
  time backstop cannot fire while inside it). `Cancelled` is never harvested
  (its result is excluded from the run). Naming an id keeps the original
  single-target behaviour.
  **Why:** dispatching a fan-out was already cheap (85% of real `Delegate`
  calls use `wait=False`) but collecting one was not — a single-target `Wait`
  left `GetStatus` polling as the only way to harvest several, and the
  poll-count nudges discourage exactly that. Across 39 cluster runs, reliance
  on `Wait` predicted serial execution (r=-0.54 vs mean concurrent
  delegations, controlling for delegation duration) against a measured mean
  concurrency of 1.21 on a median 15 delegations per run.
- **Status:** core.

## B. The deliverable (pipeline.ipynb)

### Notebook authoring + reproduction gate
- **What:** the single deliverable is a Jupyter notebook; the runtime re-executes it
  lazily and accepts it only if it runs cleanly, adds zero new oracle evals, and
  leaves the ledger unchanged. The printed `REPRODUCED:` headline is informational —
  the critic checks its provenance (it must trace to a real ledger row); the runtime
  no longer machine-matches it to an objective extremum (that wrongly rejected
  constrained optima — audit 20260624T021359).
- **Where:** `notebook_exec.py`, `nodes/tools/routing/`, `nodes/reproduction_gate.py`
  (`_reproduction_gate`).
- **Tools:** `AddPipelineCell`, `AddPipelineMarkdownCell`, `EditPipelineCell`,
  `DeletePipelineCell`, `ShowNotebook`, `WriteDeliverable`, `CheckDeliverable`.
- **Status:** core (the live deliverable).

### Per-cell notebook debugger (#13)
- **What:** run pipeline.ipynb against a *copy* of the ledger and get a per-cell
  pass/error trace, so a failing cell can be pinpointed instead of guessing.
- **Where:** `notebook_exec.py` `diagnose_notebook`, `RunPipelineCell` closure.
- **Tools:** `RunPipelineCell`. **Status:** done.

### Unified, SDK-compatible Bash surface: `Bash` + `BashOutput` + `KillShell` (#24)
- **What:** one tool SURFACE across every backend. `Bash(command, timeout?,
  run_in_background?, description?, dangerouslyDisableSandbox?)` runs foreground
  by default; a command that exceeds its timeout is **backgrounded, not killed**,
  and returned with a `bash_id` the agent polls via `BashOutput(bash_id)` and
  stops via `KillShell(bash_id)`. Matches the Claude-Agent-SDK Bash param and
  tool names so agents don't relearn behavior. The one deliberate deviation:
  auto-background is made **visible** (an `interrupted` notice + `bash_id`) so an
  agent never wakes up thinking a still-running job finished. Declared by the
  implementer, datagenerator, and debugger.
- **Two implementations, one surface** (the standard pattern here): on Claude the
  SDK executes Bash/BashOutput/KillShell natively (they are SDK built-ins — we
  now enable the two companions we had omitted from `NATIVE_TOOLS`); on
  ollama/vllm/openrouter the framework provides them via `_BashSession` +
  `_make_bash_tool`/`_make_bashoutput_tool`/`_make_killshell_tool`.
- **Safety:** framework-backgrounded children stay in the run's process group
  (no `start_new_session`), so the watchdog group-kill reaches them; the bg pid
  is best-effort registered in `governor_pids.jsonl`; `KillShell` is the only
  per-delegation teardown.
- **Where:** `backends/claude.py` (`NATIVE_TOOLS`), `backends/openai_compatible.py`
  (`_BashSession`, the three factories, `_native_tool_map`).
- **Status:** done. Supersedes the earlier `WaitForProcess` stopgap.

### Sandbox study-root anchor (`F3DASM_STUDY_ROOT`)
- **What:** the reproduction gate, `CheckDeliverable`, `RunPipelineCell`, and the
  scratch tool run against a *temp copy* of the ledger, so the store path has no
  relationship to the study repo. They now also inject `F3DASM_STUDY_ROOT` (a
  read-only anchor to the real study root) so a pillar cell can locate non-ledger
  repo resources (e.g. `bo/cei_core.py` for a surrogate self-check) deterministically
  instead of hand-rolling multi-candidate path search. Store isolation is unchanged —
  only the store is a copy; the study root is read-only reference code. The three
  duplicated sandbox-env blocks are unified in one `sandbox_env()` helper.
- **Where:** `notebook_exec.py` `sandbox_env`; call sites in `nodes/reproduction_gate.py`
  (`_reproduction_gate`) and `nodes/tools/routing/` (`RunPipelineCell`, scratch).
- **Status:** telemetry/ergonomics, not a new cap. Run 20260705T181941 friction.

### Output-column guidance fix
- **What:** notebook guidance requires naming the objective column EXPLICITLY. The
  earlier "first non-provenance output" auto-detect was unsafe: `output_names` is
  sorted, so with multiple outputs a constraint flag (e.g. `coilable`) sorts before
  the objective and gets silently picked (audit 20260624T021359). If derived, read
  `run_config['evaluator_output_names'][0]`, not column order.
- **Where:** `notebook_exec.py`. **Status:** done.

## C. Workers & ground truth

### Metered oracle (get_evaluator) + canonical ledger
- **What:** the one door to the registered ground-truth oracle; every evaluation is
  written to the canonical store with provenance, under a file lock.
- **Where:** `instrumented.py` (the wrapper), `oracle_resolution.py` (`get_evaluator`).
  **Tools (worker scratch):** `RunScratch`, `ReportEvals`.
- **Status:** core.

### Design namespaces — multiple oracles + ledgers per run (#20, Axis 3)
- **What:** a run may carry more than one oracle, one per design parametrization the
  agent invents (open design-space discovery). `get_evaluator(namespace=None)` resolves
  `run_config["oracles"][namespace]` — its own oracle + its own isolated, protected
  store; `Delegate(..., namespace="…")` scopes a worker to a namespace (injected as
  `F3DASM_NAMESPACE`, so the agent's call site stays `get_evaluator()`); the
  datagenerator registers a namespace oracle without disturbing the canonical default.
  ADDITIVE: `namespace=None` is byte-for-byte the single-study path. Comparable-by-
  construction (a new design reuses the fixed objective evaluator; see
  `OPEN_DESIGN_SPACE_FRAMEWORK.md`).
- **Where:** `oracle_resolution.py` (`get_evaluator`, `_effective_oracle_config`),
  `run_setup.py` (`register_evaluator_entrypoint(namespace=…)`), `backends/base.py`
  + `backends/claude.py` (`set_namespace`/`F3DASM_NAMESPACE`), `graph_state.py`
  (`Delegation.namespace`), `routing.py` (`Delegate` + registration handoff).
- **Report-time provenance:** `LedgerBreakdown()` (strategizer tool) shows per-experiment
  / per-delegation ledgered eval counts read live from the stores
  (`ledger_summary.ledger_breakdown`), so a writeup DERIVES counts from the ledger instead
  of hardcoding stale plan numbers (run 20260628T001710 hardcoded 70 polar evals; the
  ledger held 90 → UNGATED). It also reads `eval_budget` from run_config and prints
  `spent of budget — N remaining`, so the agent READS that number rather than hand-
  computing it and flipping spent↔remaining (run 20260628T130525 asserted "200 remain"
  with 200 spent of 300 → UNGATED). Read-only; spends no eval budget.
- **Multi-experiment load idiom:** `adda.load_experiments()` (`ledger_summary.
  load_experiments`) loads every experiment store of a run as `{name: ExperimentData}`
  (default + each design experiment, at their nested paths). A namespaced run has N
  stores and no namespace column, so the single-study `from_file` idiom silently loads
  only the default; this is the one call pipeline.ipynb uses to load them all. Wired
  into the deliverable spec (`notebook_exec.py`) and the injected paths block
  (`agent_prompts.py`).
- **Tools:** `LedgerBreakdown`.
- **Status:** plumbing complete (branch `exp/open-design-space`); gated on the 2D
  experiment before the baseline study adopts it.

### Literature reviewer
- **What:** a specialist agent that searches papers (arXiv / Semantic Scholar) and
  returns findings; degrades to lexical search without the heavy extras. Its
  corpus (`runs/lit_reviewer_notes/`) is STUDY-scoped, not per-run — it
  persists across every run of a study, since a paper's relevance to a
  domain doesn't go stale between runs the way scientific findings can
  (deliberately NOT extended to cross-run hypothesis/mechanism memory,
  which was rejected as too risky — a study's actual question can drift run
  to run). Lives under `runs/`, not the study root, to stay out of the
  user-facing study folder; guarded by a `FileLock` (not a `threading.Lock`)
  since two runs of the same study are now real, separate processes that can
  overlap and both write to it.
- **Where:** `agents/literature.py` (prompt + agent), `agents/literature_tools/`
  (one module per provider: `corpus.py`, `semantic_scholar.py`, `openalex.py`,
  `async_pool.py`, `throttle.py`), `literature/` (`literature_corpus.py` —
  the on-disk corpus; `http_client.py` — the shared per-domain rate limiter,
  circuit breaker, GET cache and `_robust_get`/`_robust_post`; `embedder.py`
  + `_embed_worker.py` — the out-of-process dense embedder),
  `runtime/agent_runtime.py`'s `_make_adapter`. **Status:** core.

### Universal read-only corpus lookup
- **What:** EVERY agent (not just the literature_reviewer) gets `ConsultLiterature`
  / `CorpusList` / `CorpusGetPaper` for free — read-only lookup against the
  study's persistent literature corpus, injected via
  `Agent.build_closure_tools`'s own default. Same rationale as `QueryStore`
  letting every node read the canonical evaluation ledger without delegating
  to the data generator: the corpus is shared, queryable infrastructure, not
  something only its specialist may read. ACQUIRING a new paper (`CorpusAdd`,
  external search) stays literature_reviewer-only — finding/vetting a new
  paper needs judgment a raw tool call can't supply, so it stays gated behind
  an actual delegation. `LiteratureReviewAgent.build_closure_tools` overrides
  the base default entirely (its own read tools + `CorpusAdd` + search) rather
  than extending it.
- **Where:** `backends/base.py`'s `Agent.build_closure_tools` default.
  **Status:** core.

### Delegation-bounded version control of the run workspace
- **What:** one git repository per run, rooted at the run's own
  `debug/delegations/` workspace, with one commit per delegation (DONE and
  FAILED alike) and the resulting sha stamped onto that delegation's record as
  `workspace_sha`. Answers "which files did this delegation change" from the
  record rather than from the deliverable's own prose — the reproduction gate
  proves the notebook runs, it cannot prove a delegation's account of its own
  edits is faithful. Agents get no git tool and never see the repo: the
  harness commits on their behalf, since an agent that can rewrite the history
  recording its work defeats the purpose. The workspace normally sits INSIDE a
  checkout of adda, so every git call pins `--git-dir`/`--work-tree`
  explicitly (no directory discovery, no walking up into the parent repo, and
  those flags outrank inherited `GIT_DIR`/`GIT_WORK_TREE`), config is passed
  per-invocation so a global `commit.gpgsign` or `core.hooksPath` cannot block
  or hijack a commit, and `.gitignore` excludes `studies/*/runs/` so the parent
  cannot absorb the nested repo as a gitlink. Never fatal: no git, no repo, or
  a failed commit records `workspace_sha=None` and the run proceeds.
- **Where:** `infra/workspace_vcs.py` (`init_workspace_repo`,
  `commit_workspace`), initialised in `runtime/agent_runtime.py::_prepare_run`,
  committed in `nodes/tools/routing/delegation.py::WorkerSession._commit_workspace`
  from both `_finish_ok` and `_finish_error`; `workspace_sha` on
  `infra/delegation_log.py::DelegationLog.record`. Retires the `### Files
  touched` report subsection: with a mechanical record, an agent re-narrating
  the same list could only agree (noise) or disagree (a contradiction with no
  rule for which wins). Intent that a diff cannot express ("rewrote main.py to
  substitute before differentiating") belongs in `### Actions taken`, which is
  already the intent section. See
  `internal/specs/11-delegation-bounded-version-control.md`. **Status:** core

### MathExpert — verified symbolic derivation
- **What:** a specialist agent (NOT part of `_default_graph()` — opt-in via a
  custom `Graph`, same precedent as `DebuggerAgent`) that authors and runs a
  Python script against `adda.Workspace` per derivation "edition"
  (`runs/math_workspace/<edition>.py`). Forces every algebraic/domain/
  dimensional claim through SymPy and reports a genuine three-valued verdict
  (`CONFIRMED`/`REFUTED`/`INCONCLUSIVE`) rather than a restated confidence; a
  physical assumption is recorded via `assume()` with a fourth verdict,
  `ASSERTED`, never adjudicated by the library. Durability and "revise an
  assumption" are both plain filesystem operations (read/rerun; copy-edit-
  rerun for a counterfactual) — no bespoke trace-replay or dependency-graph
  mechanism. `Workspace` seeds SymPy's own RNG at construction so a verdict
  that depends on `.equals()`'s randomized numerical fallback is reproducible
  across reruns of the identical script (verified directly: unseeded, this
  flips between `REFUTED`/`INCONCLUSIVE` across process runs).
  `write_summary()` writes a self-describing document
  (`{schema, workspace, counts, steps}`, each step carrying its `residual`)
  and appends that document to a sibling `<name>.history.jsonl` — one entry
  per execution, so the verdicts an edited-and-rerun script used to report
  survive being overwritten. Additive and write-only: the summary file
  remains the current state and the only thing a consumer reads.
- **Where:** `math_dsl.py` (the `Workspace` library, re-exported publicly as
  `adda.Workspace`), `agents/math_expert.py` (`MathExpertAgent`),
  `knowledge/entries/0011-symbolic-derivation-patterns.md` (worked-example
  guidance, `audience: [math_expert]`). See
  `internal/specs/10-math-expert-agent.md` for the full design rationale,
  including two heavier alternatives (a JSONL trace log, a dependency DAG)
  tried and dropped against a real published derivation. **Status:** core
  (library layer tested; graph wiring is per-study, not in the default
  topology).

### Delegation-ID allocation fix (D002)
- **What:** delegation IDs are allocated *after* the milestone gate, so a blocked
  attempt no longer burns an ID (IDs stay contiguous).
- **Where:** `nodes/tools/routing/`. **Status:** done.

## D. Resource governance (this is the big recent addition)

### Soft eval-budget nudge
- **What:** when the shared ledger crosses 80/100/150% of the eval budget, the
  *offender* (the running campaign) is nudged via its own output — capped at one per
  band. **Soft: never stops the campaign** (the eval budget is the agent's call).
- **Where:** `instrumented.py` `_flush` governor; budget plumbed via `agent_runtime.py`.
- **Config:** `eval_budget` (config.yaml / `F3DASM_EVAL_BUDGET`). **Status:** done.

### Hard memory cap (the one hard boundary)
- **What:** a 5-second watchman sums each delegation's process-tree **resident (RSS)**
  memory and kills the tree if it exceeds the cap. Real-usage based; verifies the
  process is still ours (start-time match) before killing, so a recycled PID is never
  hit. Per-delegation, absolute (not a share of system RAM), does not sum across
  delegations.
- **Where:** `studies/.../run.py` `_memory_watcher`; `watchdog_cleanup.py`
  (`check_memory_and_kill`, `_owned_pids`); `resource_backend.py`; the cap is
  resolved (config → env → SLURM allocation → default) by `runtime/run_setup.py`
  `resolve_mem_cap_bytes`.
- **Config:** `mem_cap` (config.yaml / `F3DASM_MEM_CAP`); default 4 GiB. On SLURM set
  below the job's `--mem`. **Status:** done (cgroup-native HPC backend = future seam).

### Resource backend (OS abstraction)
- **What:** one interface (`set_self_limit` / `read_rss` / `kill` / `proc_start_time`)
  so memory/kill OS-specifics live in one place; psutil impl + stdlib fallback.
- **Where:** `resource_backend.py`. **Status:** done (Linux cgroup backend = future).

### Per-delegation resource telemetry
- **What:** `GetStatus` shows a delegation's eval count, current RSS, and **peak
  RSS** (the high-water across the watcher's ticks), so the strategizer can see a
  fat or fattening campaign (and `Confer` the implementer).
- **Where:** `nodes/tools/routing/`, `watchdog_cleanup.py`
  `delegation_rss` / `delegation_peak_rss`.
- **Status:** done.

### Resource AWARENESS (telemetry, NOT enforcement)
- **What:** primes agents to be efficient with the things models ignore — time,
  RAM, disk, parallelism width — via two surfaces:
  - **Static envelope at delegation start:** a `<resources>`-style stanza in the
    worker/strategizer preamble — `~N CPU cores · RAM cap X GB (HARD — exceed it
    and your process is killed; stream/cache) · disk free Y GB · parallelize up to
    ~N ways, sized to RAM`.
  - **Measured peak RAM in the KPI footer:** `peak RAM (this delegation): Z GB of
    X GB hard cap`, the watcher's high-water — so memory cost travels with the
    result like wall-time already does.
- **Footprint (by design):** peak RAM rides the memory watcher's existing 5s poll
  (one `max()` per tick — no new poll/thread/I/O); the envelope is one
  `os.cpu_count()` + one `shutil.disk_usage` (O(1) `statvfs`, **never** a recursive
  `du`); the per-eval hot path is untouched (no per-eval RSS/disk stamping).
- **Where:** `watchdog_cleanup.py` `resource_envelope` / `delegation_peak_rss`
  (high-water recorded in `check_memory_and_kill`); `agent_runtime.py`
  `_resource_stanza`; `agent_prompts.py` `{resources}` placeholder;
  `ledger_summary.py` `delegation_footer` peak-RAM line.
- **Status:** awareness only — the hard memory cap stays the one enforced boundary.

### `mode="parallel"` host-safety hard cap
- **What:** `InstrumentedDataGenerator.call()` refuses `mode="parallel"`
  outright (raises `ValueError` before f3dasm's `DataGenerator.call()` ever
  runs) instead of relying on a prompt warning. f3dasm's own `mode="parallel"`
  falls through to a LOCAL `multiprocessing.Pool` — every solve spawns as a
  subprocess on the run's own shared orchestration node, which is CPU
  oversubscription and OOM that kills the whole run, not just one evaluation.
  A companion hard cap to `mem_cap_bytes` (§4 of the working contract): a run
  must not be able to OOM the shared node it runs on. `mode="sequential"` is
  unaffected; real parallelism belongs on a cluster scheduler (one evaluation
  per SLURM array task), not a local pool.
- **Where:** `instrumented.py` `InstrumentedDataGenerator.call`.
- **Status:** done.

### Per-delegation ledger KPIs auto-appended to the report
- **What:** when a delegation completes, a KPI footer is appended to the result
  the strategizer auto-receives (GetStatus/Confer/Done) — per-eval wall-time
  (median, max), this delegation's total eval wall-time, the ledger total, and —
  when a wall budget is set — the time remaining (telemetry, not a hard stop), so
  the median is actionable (≈ remaining / median = sims still affordable).
  Measured from the rows the delegation actually wrote, so budget planning runs
  on observed sim cost instead of an a priori per-sim estimate. Auto-delivered,
  not on-demand. Plain measurements only — interpretation is the strategizer's.
- **Where:** `ledger_summary.py` `RunStateSummary.{wall_per_delegation,
  delegation_footer}`; appended in `nodes/tools/routing/`.
- **Status:** done.

### Framework-owned local LLM on a SLURM GPU node (vLLM)
- **What:** instead of a hosted API, the framework can own the LLM *behind the
  nodes* on a separate SLURM GPU allocation: it sizes the allocation from the
  checkpoint's own published metadata (parameter count + dtype, fetched
  weights-free — local HF cache first, then a single `requests` GET of the HF
  Hub model-info JSON; no `huggingface_hub`/`transformers` dependency), so a
  full HF id or a short alias gets correctly-sized GPUs/mem with **zero user
  config**. GPU-count derivation uses a built-in per-GPU VRAM table keyed by the
  cluster's exact Slurm gres names (the Oscar/Brown-CCV inventory; hardware
  drifts far slower than model releases), defaulting to `l40s` (48 GB,
  schedulable on the general `gpu` partition) when the study names no GPU, and
  emits a type-qualified `--gres=gpu:<name>:<n>` so Slurm grants the exact card
  the size was computed for. VRAM is sized as weight-bytes(serve quant) +
  **context-aware KV cache** (read from the model config — layer count, KV
  heads/head-dim, and the sliding/global attention split, at the served context
  length and `--kv-cache-dtype`; a flat multiplier is the fallback only when the
  config lacks those fields) + a small fixed overhead. The serve quant is a
  `runtime` knob whose default is **GPU-aware**: FP8 only on FP8-capable cards
  (Ada/Hopper/Blackwell — `l40s`/`h100`/`nvidia_rtx_pro_6000_blackwell`/
  `nvidia_b200`), else a safe BF16/Q4 path, so a zero-config Ampere/Turing run
  never asks for FP8 it cannot serve; an explicit `llm_quantization=fp8` still
  wins. This lets the power model `gemma-4-31b` (30.7B) fit a single 48 GB L40S
  at FP8 weights + FP8 KV (~44 GB) while keeping its full 256K context; the same
  quant is applied to the `vllm serve` launch so sizing and serve agree. A tiny
  built-in alias table maps `gemma-4`/`gemma-4-e4b` → the cheap default and
  `gemma-4-31b` → the max-power-for-48 GB variant. Optional, purely-override layers,
  most-explicit-wins: `llm_slurm` config fields > metadata-derived sizing >
  basename-matched family *serve-hints* (context length etc. that metadata
  can't publish) > conservative default. Metadata unavailable (offline, gated
  repo, unknown GPU) degrades to a loud warning + conservative default — never
  raises, never silently mis-sizes. Then submits a `vllm serve` job (reusing f3dasm's
  `SlurmCluster` + the plain `sbatch` idiom — a persistent server is NOT routed
  through the eval-oriented `Pipeline`/`SlurmExecutor`), waits for the granted
  node, polls `/v1/models` past the cold model load, publishes `VLLM_BASE_URL`
  so the existing vLLM adapter reaches it over the cluster network, and
  scancels the job on EVERY exit path (normal close, crash, and the watchdog's
  `os._exit` hard-kill via `reap_run_serve_job`). A build-time, leading-order
  throughput bound (decode is memory-bandwidth-bound; GPU/model-size/dtype/
  tensor-parallel are all config-known) warns loudly when a config is likely to
  choke — a nudge at config time, never a block. Same physics the token
  telemetry measures after the fact (parity). Phase 1: one allocation for the
  run's lifetime; Phase 2 (walltime chaining + a stable local proxy) is designed
  but deferred.
- **Config (all optional overrides):** `llm_slurm:` block — `enabled`
  (default off), `model`, `aliases` (short-name→canonical-HF-id map; wins over
  the built-in aliases), resource overrides
  (`gres`/`mem`/`time`/`cpus_per_task`/`vllm_args`), sizing/throughput inputs
  (`gpu_model`/`params_b`/`dtype_bytes`/`tensor_parallel`), `queue_timeout`/
  `serve_timeout`, and a nested `cluster:` (`partition`/`account`/`env_setup`/
  `env_vars`/`runner`). Metadata knobs live in the `runtime:` block via
  `settings.get_*`: `llm_metadata_fetch` (bool, default on — off = local-cache
  only, no network), `llm_metadata_timeout_s` (float, default 8), and
  `llm_quantization` (str; unset → GPU-aware default: FP8 on FP8-capable cards
  else BF16/Q4. Set `fp8`/`bf16`/`fp16`/`awq`/`gptq`/`q4`/…, or `auto` for the
  checkpoint's native dtype) — the serve dtype used for both VRAM sizing and the
  `vllm serve --quantization` flag; an explicit value wins over the GPU-aware
  default. Requires
  `backend: vllm`. Disabled → hosted-API runs are unchanged.
- **Where:** `agentic/slurm_llm.py` (aliases, metadata fetch, VRAM sizing,
  serve-hints, resolve, render/submit, wait, throughput bound, teardown,
  reaper); `agent_runtime.py`
  (`_maybe_start_slurm_llm` + the teardown `finally` in `execute()`);
  `studies/*/run.py` watchdogs (serve-job reap). Reuses
  `pipeline/resources.py` (`SlurmCluster`/`SlurmResources`) unchanged.
- **Status:** Phase 1 done, headless-tested; validate on a real GPU cluster
  before making it a default anywhere (greenfield + cluster-specific).

## E. Runtime safety

### Wall-clock watchdog + recursive reap (#11/#14)
- **What:** a hard wall-clock timer force-exits a stalled run; on exit it recursively
  kills every campaign process tree — including detached/new-session ones that a
  process-group kill misses.
- **Where:** `studies/.../run.py` `_watchdog` (the out-of-repo benchmarks harness'
  own launcher) and, in THIS repo, `python -m adda.watchdog` (BACKLOG #41 — see
  below), both driving `watchdog_cleanup.py`'s `reap_process_group` /
  `reap_governor_pids`.
- **Config:** watchdog = 2× the run's time budget (a floor, not a default —
  `adda.watchdog`'s `--watchdog-multiple` can only raise it). Operational
  kill-switch `F3DASM_DISABLE_WATCHDOG=1` turns the wall-clock force-exit OFF
  (the memory-cap watcher stays on) on the out-of-repo harness — for long
  supervised runs. **Status:** done.

### Delegate() time cutoff + escalating budget wrap-up ladder
- **What:** two additions to the existing soft-budget/backstop ladder, both a
  NEW HARD CAP on the time budget (a science budget — CLAUDE.md §4 — approved
  explicitly by the maintainer for this one case; eval budgets remain soft
  and untouched):
  1. Past `runtime: delegate_cutoff_multiple` × the (soft) time budget (default
     `1.5`, disabled at `<= 0`), `Delegate()` refuses to start a NEW
     delegation — an actionable `ERROR:` string, no delegation registered.
     Every other close-out tool (`Wait`, `GetStatus`, `Done`, deliverable
     tools) is untouched, and an in-flight delegation started before the
     cutoff is never cancelled or disturbed — only NEW ones are refused, so
     the run always has a path to close. Sits one rung below
     `run_backstop_multiple` (which force-closes the run); if the cutoff
     multiple is misconfigured `>=` the backstop multiple, `AgenticRun`
     warns loudly at startup (it can never fire — the run closes first).
  2. Every node — not only an orchestrating one — gets an escalating
     wrap-up message once per newly-crossed 10%-of-budget band at/past 100%
     (100, 110, 120, …), instead of the strategizer's old every-turn repeat
     past 1.0×. A worker (leaf node, or a `Delegate()`-spawned WorkerSession)
     is told what it can actually do (finish the step, report what you have,
     return) — never "call Done()", which only the strategizer holds. The
     strategizer's own band message additionally says new delegations are
     now refused once the cutoff multiple is actually passed.
- **Where:** knobs in `nodes/_constants.py` (`delegate_cutoff_multiple`,
  `delegate_cutoff_enabled`); the refusal in
  `nodes/tools/routing/delegation.py::DelegationTools._check_delegate_cutoff`
  (called first thing in `Delegate()`); the shared ladder
  (`budget_band_due`, `budget_wrapup_message`) in `nodes/_constants.py`,
  called from `orchestration.py::_budget_warnings` (every node's own turn —
  `_respond`/`leaf.py` are gone; every node now runs the same
  `_orchestrate` loop) and `delegation.py::_budget_broadcast` (the
  WorkerSession path a `Delegate()` worker actually runs through in the
  built-in graph); the misconfiguration warning in
  `runtime/agent_runtime.py::_warn_if_delegate_cutoff_unreachable`.
  Diagnostic: `DELEGATE_CUTOFF` via the existing `_record_intervention`
  mechanism (`diagnostics.jsonl`), the same channel `MILESTONE_BLOCK` uses.
- **Status:** done, headless-tested (`tests/test_delegate_time_cutoff.py`,
  `tests/test_budget_wrapup_ladder.py`).

### `python -m adda.watchdog` — the in-package run launcher (#41)
- **What:** a launcher that runs a study as a CHILD process, in its own process
  group, and owns the wall-clock deadline from the PARENT — the maintainer's
  explicit design (`paper/sections/03-method.tex`, "A wall-clock watchdog
  outside the run": an in-process backstop that may itself be stuck cannot be
  trusted). `python -m adda <study-dir>` itself stays exactly as unprotected as
  before — this is an additional, safer way to launch the same run. On timeout
  it SIGTERMs the whole child process group, escalates to SIGKILL if anything
  survives a short grace period, reaps any registered campaign PIDs the run
  spawned (`reap_governor_pids` — catches the detached/new-session descendants
  a plain process-group signal misses), and appends a labelled
  `write_watchdog_retrospective` post-mortem to the run's
  `retrospectives.jsonl`. Exits `124` (distinguishable from any real exit code
  the run itself could produce) on a kill; propagates the run's own exit
  status otherwise.
- **Deadline:** derived from the SAME budget value the run itself resolves
  (`--budget`, or `config.yaml`'s `budget:`, via the shared
  `run_setup._parse_budget_str`) at the 2× floor (`--watchdog-multiple`, never
  settable below 2.0) — the two values can never silently disagree. Refuses to
  run at all if no budget can be resolved.
- **Where:** `_src/infra/watchdog_launcher.py` (`run_under_watchdog`,
  `resolve_deadline_seconds`, `main`); thin top-level forwarding package
  `adda/watchdog/` mirrors `adda/viewer/`'s own convention.
- **Status:** done, headless-tested (`tests/test_watchdog_launcher.py`) against
  a trivial sub-second child, including a grandchild-reap assertion.

### Synthetic watchdog retrospective (#12)
- **What:** a watchdog kill leaves a labelled post-mortem so the analysis protocol
  isn't blind.
- **Where:** `watchdog_cleanup.py` `write_watchdog_retrospective`, called from
  `_src/infra/watchdog_launcher.py` on a timeout (see #41 above) and from the
  out-of-repo campaign runner's own watchdog. **Status:** done, and now has an
  in-package caller — a watchdog kill via `python -m adda.watchdog` is
  protected locally, not only on the out-of-repo harness.

### Fallback retrospective on a non-compliant close
- **What:** every in-process close that never reaches the entry node's real,
  first-person retrospective — UNGATED, FAILED, an external stop, or an
  unhandled crash (`GraphRecursionError`/`KeyboardInterrupt`/OOM) — still
  gets one, synthesized from disk state and clearly marked as such
  (`source_id` prefixed `SYNTHESIZED:`). "Capture, don't request": the
  post-Done exit interview asks for one more cooperative Done() call, and
  nothing used to enforce the reply actually arrived.
- **Where:** `watchdog_cleanup.py` `write_fallback_retrospective` (shares its
  disk-reading/append core with `write_watchdog_retrospective` rather than
  duplicating it); called from `agent_runtime.py`
  `AgenticRun._fallback_retrospective`, wired at both the normal close
  (`_finalize_run`) and the crash path (`_invoke_graph`'s
  `except BaseException`, before the re-raise). Idempotent — a compliant
  close's real entry is never duplicated. **Status:** done for every
  in-process close; a watchdog kill is a SEPARATE case, covered by
  `write_watchdog_retrospective` instead (see #12 above).

### KB (handbook) entries
- **What:** curated knowledge the agents consult (incl. running on SLURM, pipeline
  patterns). **Where:** `knowledge/entries/`. **Status:** core.
- **Injected menu:** an audience-filtered, one-line-per-entry MENU
  (`KnowledgeBase.menu(audience)`) is injected into every agent's system prompt
  (`agent_runtime._kb_menu` → the `{knowledge}` placeholder in both preambles), so
  an agent always SEES the latent chapters it can pull — the same way it always
  sees its tool list — instead of only discovering one if it already thought to
  call `ConsultHandbook`. The descriptor is the entry `title`, capped to one terse
  line by a ≤100-char invariant (`test_knowledge_base.py`).

### Run architecture diagram
- **What:** `AgenticRun.render_architecture(out_path=None)` renders THIS run's
  actual agent graph — every node, its role, its description, its RESOLVED
  backend/model (each node can override either independently, matching
  `agent_runtime.py`'s own `agent.model or self._model` resolution — shown
  per card, never as one run-wide banner), its full tool surface, and the
  delegation edges between nodes — as a single self-contained, hand-laid-out
  SVG. No cap on the tool list: a card grows to fit everything rather than
  truncating with a "see agent source for the full list" cop-out. Generated
  straight from the live `Graph`/`Agent` objects (BFS-layered from the entry
  node, not run through Graphviz or any auto-layout engine), so it cannot
  silently go stale the way this repo's previous diagram did (a hand-authored
  `internal/class_diagram.dot` describing classes that no longer existed —
  deleted in favor of this). The tool surface includes each agent's REAL
  runtime-injected closures (`Agent.build_closure_tools()`), not just its
  statically declared `.tools` — LiteratureReviewAgent declares only
  `{Read, Grep, Glob, ReadProblemStatement}`; every actual capability
  (CorpusAdd/Search/List/GetPaper, arXiv/OpenAlex/Semantic Scholar search) is
  injected at runtime, and a first draft that only read `.tools` silently
  showed it as having almost no tools. Every edge renders identically — one
  delegation mechanism (`Delegate`) exists in the code, so there is no
  invented "primary vs lateral" edge taxonomy or line-style split (an early
  draft fabricated one; caught and removed). Each tool name is color-coded by
  a real per-tool key: the SAME tool renders in the SAME color everywhere it
  appears, so a repeating color across different cards is what visually says
  "these nodes share this capability" — a tool unique to one node renders in
  plain neutral ink instead. No title, no node/edge-count banner, no legend —
  the cards and edges are the whole diagram. SVG is the native, checked-in
  format: vector by construction, so any DPI or pixel size is one
  rasterization step away with zero quality loss — no separate PNG-export
  code ships here.
- **Where:** `run_diagram.py` (the renderer); `agent_runtime.py`'s
  `AgenticRun.render_architecture`. **Status:** done.

### Live run viewer (read-only)
- **What:** `python -m adda.viewer <study-dir>` (or
  `AgenticRun.serve_viewer(host, port)`) serves a local, read-only web UI for
  watching a run WHILE it's in progress — a live network diagram of the
  agent graph (node positions reuse `run_diagram.py`'s own `_bfs_layers`
  layout; a status dot per node, driven by Server-Sent Events, distinguishes
  running/done/failed), and clicking a node opens a docked bottom panel
  (maximizable to full-screen, VS Code's own `toggleMaximizedPanel`
  convention) showing that node's live tool-call/conversation transcript as
  Claude-Code-style chat bubbles with tool calls collapsed by default. Reuses
  existing data wholesale rather than adding new instrumentation:
  `delegation_log.jsonl`/`diagnostics.jsonl` (already live, append-only) via
  `DelegationLog.query_all()`'s own collapse-by-id logic, and
  `debug/transcripts/` (only present when a run was started with the debug
  flag on — the UI says so plainly rather than showing a blank pane).
  Explicit, honest limitation surfaced in the UI itself: the on-disk
  delegation-status vocabulary is richer than a fixed enum (confirmed for
  real: a Done()-gate check logs `"GATE:PASS"`, not a plain `RUNNING`/`DONE`)
  and still lacks the in-process registry's finer states (`Working`/
  `FollowUp`/`Cancelled` are never persisted) — a delegation blocked on a
  human follow-up question is indistinguishable on disk from one simply
  still running. No build step: Tailwind CDN + htmx + Alpine.js, one static
  HTML template. Binds to `127.0.0.1`, no auth. No longer read-only: see
  **Operator channel** below for the write path (answering a `FollowUp`,
  queueing a note, nudging a running delegation).
- **Where:** `src/adda/_src/viewer/` (`readers.py` pure data functions,
  `app.py` the Starlette app, `templates/graph.html` the UI);
  `agent_runtime.py`'s `AgenticRun.serve_viewer`; `pyproject.toml`'s `viewer`
  optional-dependency group. **Status:** done (v1, read-only).

### Notice provenance — telling adda's voice from a tool's output
- **What:** every piece of text adda injects into an agent's context —
  nudges, science-monitor drift, budget warnings, operator notes, Confer
  messages, delegation notifications — is wrapped in an `<adda-note>` marker
  at the point of injection. The viewer lifts marked blocks out of the tool
  result and renders them in their own band (`--surface0`, peach left rule)
  above the tool's own output (`--crust`).
- **Where:** `nodes/notices.py` (`wrap_notice` / `split_notices` and the
  marker); seven injection sites in `nodes/orchestration.py`
  (`_drain_notifications`) and `nodes/tools/routing/` (worker-message
  drains in `ReportEvals`/`FollowUp`/`GetStatus`, the `GetStatus` poll hints,
  and the science-monitor drains in both `Wait` branches);
  `viewer/app.py::_tool_result_html` renders them.
- **Why marked at the source, not detected by the reader:** the pre-existing
  `[TAG …]` convention is incomplete (the `GetStatus` poll hints are bare
  prose), and brackets are not a safe signal because tools emit their own
  (`[exited 1]`, `[output truncated to last …]`). A marker is a tag rather
  than a control character because this text is part of the agent's prompt
  and has to stay readable; it matches the `<role>`/`<tools>` idiom the
  prompt corpus already uses.
- **Side effect, deliberate:** `ERROR_RETURN` styling in the viewer is now
  tested on the tool's output with the notice removed. It was tested on the
  raw text, so any result carrying an injected prefix failed the
  `startswith("ERROR")` check and silently lost its error styling.
- **Status:** core. Note the marker is visible to the agent as well as the
  reader — it labels the text truthfully, but it does change prompt content.

### Operator channel — answering, noting, and nudging a live run
- **What:** a human can act on a run in flight, from the viewer or a
  terminal. Three things move across it, all as small JSON in the run's own
  `debug/` dir (the run and the viewer are separate processes, so the file
  system is the channel; it also makes the whole exchange part of the run
  record rather than terminal scrollback): **answers** to a `FollowUp`
  question; **notes** queued for the entry node's next tool call; and a
  **watch heartbeat**, which is what lets a run tell waiting-for-an-answer
  apart from stalling on a question nobody can see.
  A note may carry the **delegation id** it is aimed at. Addressed at a
  RUNNING delegation it is routed onto that worker's per-delegation queue
  and prefixed onto its next tool result — the same path `Confer` and the
  budget warnings use — so the operator can correct work already in flight
  instead of waiting for a wrong result. Addressed at a finished delegation
  it goes to the entry node with the intended recipient named, never
  silently dropped. Routing happens in the orchestrator's note drain because
  that drain claims the queue destructively; anywhere else and an addressed
  note would be swallowed before the router saw it. Delivery therefore
  depends on the orchestrator taking a tool call (it drains on
  `GetStatus`/`Wait`), so a strategizer blocked in a long synchronous
  `Delegate(wait=True)` will not route a nudge until it returns.
- **Where:** `src/adda/_src/operator_channel.py` (`ask_question`,
  `answer_question`, `queue_note`, `drain_note_rows`, `touch_watch`,
  `is_watched`); routing in `nodes/orchestration.py`'s `_drain_notifications`;
  HTTP surface in `viewer/app.py` (`/answer`, `/note`); composers in
  `viewer/templates/graph.html`. **Status:** done.

## Tools (every one must be documented above; the test enforces it)

| Tool | Feature |
|---|---|
| `Delegate` | Delegation (dynamically injected) |
| `GetStatus` · `Wait` · `FollowUp` · `Confer` · `ReportEvals` | Delegation + messaging + telemetry |
| `AddPipelineCell` · `AddPipelineMarkdownCell` · `EditPipelineCell` · `DeletePipelineCell` · `ShowNotebook` · `WriteDeliverable` · `CheckDeliverable` | Notebook authoring + reproduction gate. Three markdown-cell names are RESERVED with an auto-added canonical heading (`problem`, `hypotheses`, `verdict` — the last is `<deliverable_format>` step 7, `## Verdict & result`, ahead of the analysis pillar); any other name is a free-form custom narrative cell (content used verbatim, no forced heading), mirroring `AddPipelineCell`'s own non-standard-phase philosophy — the deliverable's structure must not block what an agent needs to say. Only a pillar name or `<pillar>__why` collides and is rejected |
| `RunPipelineCell` | Per-cell notebook debugger (#13) |
| `RunScratch` | Worker scratch execution against a ledger copy |
| `WriteNote` · `ReadNote` | Agent scratch notes |
| `RecallStore` · `QueryStore` | Canonical evaluation-store read (declaration-gated; shared verbatim across node types — strategizer, workers, and the critic). `QueryStore` accepts `where=` (a pandas `query()` expression over the joined inputs+outputs frame — compound feasibility predicates + arithmetic on input columns in one call) and `limit=` (lifts the 20-row default listing cap); bad `where` returns a column-listing ERROR, never raises (spec 09). The list/`where` view surfaces INPUT columns (a design's coordinates, not just its outputs), and an empty match reports `0 of N scanned` as an unambiguous TRUE zero (distinct from a missing column, which ERRORs) — UNLESS `where=` exact-`==`s a float-dtype column, in which case the zero-row message hedges ("NOT necessarily a true zero") and hints at an `abs(x-v)<1e-6` tolerance predicate instead, since a real row can be silently excluded by float representation error alone (run 20260825T012642: independently hit by the strategizer and 3 of 8 critic rounds, each paying a diagnosis cycle to find the same workaround). Heuristic (regex `col==literal`, checked against the joined frame's dtype), scoped to int/bool exact-`==` staying untouched (e.g. `feasible==1` is not float-precision-sensitive). `columns=` narrows which COLUMNS are shown (the row-narrowing analogue of `where=`/`limit=`) — a wide store's rows can overflow the response token limit even after `where=`/`limit=` have already cut the row count down (run 20260816T013744, 449,879 chars from a single call); `_namespace` is always kept regardless of `columns=`, and a requested column that doesn't exist returns a column-listing ERROR, same convention as `where=` |
| `OracleStatus` | On-demand read of the CURRENT canonical oracle registration — `run_config.json`'s `evaluator_entrypoint`/`evaluator_lookup`/`evaluator_output_names` plus any per-namespace `oracles` entries, read fresh on every call. Declaration-gated to strategizer/datagenerator/implementer/critic/debugger. Exists because `register_evaluator_entrypoint()` can repoint the canonical entrypoint BETWEEN delegations (whenever a datagenerator delegation authors/extends the generator), and the only prior signal was a one-shot `[Evaluator registered: ...]` notification a busy agent could fail to reconcile with its own stated beliefs — which cost one wasted real evaluation job before a delegation self-diagnosed via bit-identical outputs (run 20260717T014507) |
| `HypothesisPropose` · `HypothesisUpdate` · `HypothesisList` · `HypothesisGet` · `LinkFalsificationAttempt` | Hypothesis ledger — read (List/Get) is declaration-gated to any node; mutate (Propose/Update/Link) is strategizer-only |
| `MilestoneList` · `MilestonePropose` · `MilestoneComplete` · `MilestoneSkip` | Process milestones (strategizer-only) |
| `ReadProblemStatement` | Verbatim read of PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md — declaration-gated, uniform across all 6 default agents (strategizer, literature_reviewer, data_generator, implementer, critic, debugger). Replaces the old `inject_problem_statement` push flag (which only ever set `True` on the literature reviewer and was checked only inside `Delegate()`, so no other worker could reach the run's actual goal/success-criteria text at all) with one pull-based tool every agent has equally |
| `BashOutput` · `KillShell` | Bash companions: poll / stop a backgrounded shell (#24) |
| `Read` · `Write` · `Edit` · `Bash` · `Glob` · `Grep` | Workspace file/shell primitives |
| `Done` | Close the run for the gate |
