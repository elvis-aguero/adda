"""Generate the prompt & gate provenance map.

Answers, for every role in the default graph, the only two questions a
reviewer of an agentic system actually asks:

  1. What EXACTLY does this agent see?   (the assembled system prompt,
     split into its real sections, each one traced to ``file:line``)
  2. What can STOP it?                   (every gate, hard or soft, its
     source, its escape hatch, its kill switch)

Everything here is READ OFF THE SYSTEM, never hand-typed:

* prompt text comes from the live ``Graph``/``Agent`` objects built by
  ``agents/_graphs.py`` — the same objects ``agent_runtime.py`` runs;
* section boundaries come from the prompts' own ``<tag>`` structure, not
  from an invented taxonomy layered on top;
* ``file:line`` for every section is resolved by locating that exact text
  in the source tree, so a moved prompt moves its citation with it;
* the Done() gate chain is parsed out of the literal tuple in
  ``feedback.py`` — its ORDER is the source's order, not a guess;
* every gate's summary is its own live docstring.

The one hand-maintained thing is ``GATES``: which symbols count as gates.
Each entry is RESOLVED against the AST at build time, so a renamed or
deleted gate fails the build loudly instead of leaving a stale card in a
map someone is about to present. That is the whole anti-drift contract —
the same one ``runtime/run_diagram.py`` adopted after this repo's
hand-authored class diagram rotted.

Usage::

    python internal/tools/promptmap.py                 # -> internal/promptmap.html
    python internal/tools/promptmap.py --json-only     # -> stdout
    python internal/tools/promptmap.py --stamp         # adds a build stamp
                                                         # (see note below)

RUN THIS ON PYTHON 3.12, NOT WHATEVER IS DEFAULT. Every citation's
``file:line`` is resolved via ``ast``, and 3.12 changed how the parser
attributes line numbers (decorators, multi-line calls); 3.10/3.11 and
3.12/3.13 each produce internally-consistent but MUTUALLY DIFFERENT byte
output for identical prompt text. CI's byte-diff gate (``check_promptmap``)
is pinned to 3.12, so a regeneration on any other interpreter will look
wrong there even though nothing you wrote changed. ``make promptmap`` pins
this already -- prefer it. Run this file directly only as
``uv run --python 3.12 python internal/tools/promptmap.py``.

The committed ``internal/promptmap.html`` is generated with NO flags. Its
embedded data deliberately carries no ``generated_at``/``commit`` fields: an
embedded commit hash can never be correct, because the hash of the commit
that would contain it is not known until after that commit is made -- so the
stamp is structurally always one commit stale, and it turns every
regeneration (content unchanged or not) into a full-payload diff, since the
whole map is one line of JSON. Provenance for this file belongs to git's own
history of it (``git log -- internal/promptmap.html``), not to bytes inside
it. Pass ``--stamp`` only for an interactive, uncommitted copy that wants a
human-readable "as of" line.
