# Pinned to 3.12: promptmap.py resolves citations via `ast`, whose line
# attribution differs between 3.10/3.11 and 3.12/3.13 -- an unpinned run
# regenerates byte-different output depending on whichever interpreter is
# in .venv, and CI's raw-byte `check_promptmap` job is itself pinned to
# 3.12, so this must match it exactly.

# The committed paper/main.pdf is a generated artifact, so it must not depend
# on WHEN or WHERE it was built: pdfTeX stamps a creation date and a random
# document /ID, which would make every rebuild a diff even with the .tex
# unchanged (and a binary, unmergeable one). SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH + the
# \pdftrailerid{} in main.tex pin both, so the PDF only changes when the paper
# does. Deliberately NOT gated in CI -- a stale PDF is not a correctness
# failure, and nobody's build should break over a document.
