"""Custom-graph runner for the MathExpert validation study.

No DataGenerator/Implementer -- see PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md. Graph:
    strategizer (entry) -> literature_reviewer
                         -> math_expert
                         -> critic
    math_expert          -> literature_reviewer   (its one outgoing edge,
                                                    grants Delegate/Wait/Reply)

The critic is present so Done() faces a real acceptance gate. Without it
the run 20260905T162233 closed GATED having produced nothing at all.

Single-variable test of a local-model serving path: math_expert ONLY points
at a local endpoint when either VLLM_BASE_URL or OLLAMA_BASE_URL is set in
the environment; strategizer and literature_reviewer stay on Haiku
regardless -- deliberately isolating "does a local-model delegation work at
all" from "does a local model handle the full strategizer tool-calling
surface," which is a much bigger, separate question not being tested here.

vLLM path (~/.local/bin/vllm-serve-oscar.sh) hit a real dependency wall:
vllm==0.28.0's own precompiled C extension needs a CUDA 13 runtime this
cluster's L40S driver does not support (confirmed: torch itself correctly
resolved to a 12.9-compatible build via --torch-backend=auto, but vllm's
extension has libcudart.so.13 baked in at PyPI build time regardless).
Switched to Ollama (~/.local/bin/ollama-serve-oscar.sh), which ships its own
bundled runtime and already has qwen3.8:27b confirmed working on this
cluster's L40S via agentsoscar.sh's own prior real usage.

Usage:
  uv run python studies/mathexpert_kinematic_matching_test/run.py                     # all-Haiku
  OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:<port>/v1 \\
    uv run python studies/mathexpert_kinematic_matching_test/run.py                   # math_expert on Ollama
