"""Quota probe: does adda's own Claude Code CLI invocation still work at
all right now, as cheaply as possible?

Graph: strategizer (entry) -> critic. All-Haiku, run locally (not Oscar,
no SLURM) -- deliberately removes every other moving part (cluster, tunnel,
local model serving) so a failure here can only mean one thing: the
account-level block a prior Oscar run hit (BACKLOG #34,
"You've hit your org's monthly spend limit") is still active for ANY
Claude usage, not just heavy/automated runs.

Usage:
  uv run python studies/quota_probe_test/run.py
